A strong candidate will display\nconsistency based on his or her brainstorm from Q3 and cite relevant insights to support the recommendation, along with\nmentioning profit margins (if calculated) A strong candidate should also recognize short and intermediate-term risks and\nsuggest tangible methods for mitigation.\n• An example recommendation:\no\n\n“I recommend for NLG to pursue the free-to-play business model. This model captures the largest player base which\nputs NLG in a strong position against competitive threats. It also allows NLG to launch future games, expand to\nnew geographies, or move into other platforms such as console or mobile. Even though short-term financial benefits\nare equivalent to that of subscription, the free-to-play model puts NLG in a more competitive position long-term.”\n\no\n\n“Key risks associated with free-to-play model is generating a sufficient percent of paying players and growing revenue per\nplayer. To mitigate this risk, I recommend designing two types of in-game purchases. Players can either pay to “beautify”\nin- game characters to improve aesthetic appeal; or, players can pay to expedite the levelling journey and save time from\n“grinding” through stages. These efforts will help NLG capture a sufficient segment of paying customers based on two\nsustainable value propositions.”\n\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\n54\n\n\fThe Pricing Games: Exhibit 1\n\nPredicted Revenues\n\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\nSubscription\n\nRetail\n\nFree-To-Play*\n\nTarget Audience\n\n10M\n\n10M\n\n10M\n\nPredicted Market Share\n\n10%\n\n12%\n\n50%\n\n% Buy In-Game Content\n\n-\n\n-\n\n30%\n\nMonthly Subscription Fees\n\n$10\n\n-\n\n-\n\nRetail Price\n\n-\n\n$60\n\n-\n\nAnnual In-Game Purchases\n\n-\n\n-\n\n$100\n\n55\n\n\fThe Pricing Games: Exhibit 2\n\nCost Structure\nSubscription\n\nRetail\n\nFree-To-Play*\n\nAnnual Variable Cost\n\n$50\n\n$22\n\n$13\n\nCustomer Acquisition Cost\n\n$35\n\n$18\n\n$7\n\nAnnual Product Dev\n\n$5 M\n\n$5 M\n\n$5 M\n\nServer Costs\n\n$7 M\n\n$7 M\n\n$7 M\n\nOther Fixed Costs\n\n$3 M\n\n$3 M\n\n$3 M\n\n*Per customer costs in the table are for all customers, including non-paying customers.\nPaying customers incur an additional average variable cost of $10\n\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\n56\n\n\fThe Pricing Games: Exhibit 3\n\nSurvey Response (5 = most likely, 1 = least likely)\n\nSurvey Info From Beta Test (n=100)\n4.8\n\n5\n4.5\n\n4.2\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4.1\n\n4.2\n\n3.6\n\n3.5\n3\n2.3\n\n2.5\n\n1.9\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n1.5\n1.5\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\nContinue playing this Purchase add-ons to\ngame after first year?\nthe base game?\nSubscription\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\nRecommend to\nfriends?\n\nUpfront Purchase\n57\n\nFree to Play\n\nSwitch to a new game\nin the same genre?",

This model captures the largest player base which\nputs NLG in a strong position against competitive threats. It also allows NLG to launch future games, expand to\nnew geographies, or move into other platforms such as console or mobile. Even though short-term financial benefits\nare equivalent to that of subscription, the free-to-play model puts NLG in a more competitive position long-term.”\n\no\n\n“Key risks associated with free-to-play model is generating a sufficient percent of paying players and growing revenue per\nplayer. To mitigate this risk, I recommend designing two types of in-game purchases. Players can either pay to “beautify”\nin- game characters to improve aesthetic appeal; or, players can pay to expedite the levelling journey and save time from\n“grinding” through stages. These efforts will help NLG capture a sufficient segment of paying customers based on two\nsustainable value propositions.”"

The other initiative is a professional development tool to help the teachers\nwith developing and effectively providing a remote curriculum to the students. The team that worked on the strategic\nplanning determined that the cost would be $1M.

It is based on annual revenues\nand annual pancreatic cancer diagnoses. Assume that the price charged to each patient diagnosed in a given year is the expected present value of\nthe course of treatment.\n∙\n∙\n∙\n∙\n∙\n\nThere are four major companies in this space: Sternofi and competitors A, B, and C, and several other smaller companies that capture the\nbalance of the market.\nCompetitor A has 50% greater market share by patients than Competitor B. Competitor C has two thirds less market share by patient than\nCompetitor A. We expect that Sternofi will capture twice Competitor B’s market share by patient. The other companies capture the balance,\nwhich is 15,000 patients per year. Overall, approximately 65,000 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year.\nFrom a revenue perspective, “other” companies capture one fifth of the $1.5B annual market.\nCompetitor C is priced the same as the average of the “other” contingent. Competitor B charges 25% more than that, and Competitor A\ncharges $10,000 per treatment less than C.\nWhat are the expected revenues and unit prices for Sternofi?\n\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\n177\n\n\fSternofi: Question 1 (cont.)\nNotes to the interviewer:\n∙\no\n\nCompany\nSternofi\nA\nB\nC\nOther\nTotal\n\nMarket\nShare (000s,\nrelative)\n2X\n1.5X\nX\n0.5X\n15\n65\n\nMarket\nPrice per\nshare\n(000s,\npatient\nRevenues\nabsolute)\n(000s)\n(millions)\n20\n35\n700\n15\n10\n150\n10\n25\n250\n5\n20\n100\n15\n20\n300\n65\n1500\n\nNote: information shaded in orange is provided in the prompt, and\ninformation shaded in green is to be calculated by the candidate.\n\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\no\no\n∙\no\no\no\n\n178\n\nNotes\nCandidates are welcome to ask to repeat any information given –\nthis is an opportunity to assess their poise in willingness to ask for\nhelp.

What does this tell you?\n\nNotes to Interviewer:\n• Ideally, interviewees should drive to this on their own, as they were told the company has an existing plan. If the interviewee doesn’t\nask for details from the existing plan, provide Exhibit 1.\n• There are two things for candidates to calculate with Exhibit 1 – the reduction in space requirement based on current employee\nutilization, and the current cost of rent (see calculations below). If the candidate doesn’t identify these calculations, prompt them.\n• If the candidate asks if the current space is optimal, the answer is yes.\n\n• Strong candidates will also calculate the square footage needed per employee by space type\n• Excellent candidates will note that employee utilization does not impact the size of the server room required. If asked, provide this\nguidance.\nOnce this math is complete, candidates should then consider the alternative, and ask if the company has any new spaces they\nare considering.\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\n208\n\n\fHybrid Work Model: Question 2\nQuestion:\n• The real estate team found a new space and need to move on the opportunity quickly due to multiple competing bids. Under the new\nlocation’s lease, how much can they save on an annual basis?\n\nNotes to Interviewer:\n• Provide Exhibit 2 when asked about alternatives / the new location and lease (or prompt the candidate if they don’t raise the topic).\nIdeally, candidates should drive to this on their own, as the new location’s lease is referenced in the question.\n• Candidates may immediately calculate the cost of the new lease and identify the annual savings.\n• Excellent candidates will identify that the square footage per employee has changed, and question if the new space really meets the\ncompany’s needs. The interviewer should not give guidance on this – data will come later.\n• Strong interviewees will note that the space does not have a server room. If candidates don’t note this, prompt them by\nasking how they know the space meets all requirements.\n• Provide the following information only when asked: The company plans to move their server room offsite, and has found a 1,000\nsf location in New Jersey that costs $5 per square foot per month.\nOnce this math is complete, candidate should then consider the costs and benefits of making this change.

The interviewee should recognize that both have\nsimilar expertise scores and upfront deployment costs. General medicinal delivery is the more attractive option because it also has\ntop need and impact scores\n• A good interviewee will identify the best product based on the information given\n• A great interviewee will draw additional insights related to product and market fit: vaccines are light and easy to transport via drone,\nsimple to administer, and fulfills a need in developing countries.

The non-profit aims to provide\ndisadvantaged high school age students with leadership training and career development through an increasingly popular sport, curling. Curling\nis a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice toward a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles. C&C rents out ice\nhockey rinks around the city to host weekly curling practices and games. Students are also able to opt-in to leadership skills workshops,\nprofessional development sessions, and one-on-one mentoring. High school students apply to join C&C as an extracurricular after school\nprogram. The program is provided free of charge due to the generous support of large institutional donors. C&C’s main costs include facility\nrental, curling equipment, transportation, staff salaries, and administrative overhead.\nC&C has been growing quickly since 2021 when students returned to the classroom full-time and are unable to meet demand for all their\nprogramming. How can they increase their impact?",

Ages 14 – 18,\ncoming from all of NYC\n• Students can opt-in to any of the offered sessions\n• Students are transported from school to the curling\ncenter. The weekly schedule varies, but always\nincludes both curling and educational events\n• To qualify for the program, students’ families must\nbe under a certain income criteria\n• Staff on payroll include: coaches, mentors,\nadministrative personnel, and program coordinators\nImpact:\n• The goal is to try to serve more students and meet\ndemand. No clear target\n\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\n• Financial Constraints:\no FC cost increases (facility rent, transport vans, labor, SG&A)\no VS cost increased (fuel, curling equipment, water, snacks, app fees)\no Decreases in donation cash flow\n• Non-Financial Constraints:\no Number of staff and labor allocation\no Facility or transport capacity limitations\no Program cycle/scheduling\no COVID regulations\no Administrative backlogs (applications, onboarding etc.)\n• Interviewer Note: An exceptional interviewee will be specific and maintain non-profit\npriorities (youth empowerment) rather than just providing typical cost analysis\n\n302\n\n\fCurling and Careers: Chart Reading\nQuestion 1:\n• Provide Exhibit 1\n• C&C has done an analysis of the different aspects of their program.

This can be ignored because the New York area curling facilities have limited arena availability and\ntherefore C&C cannot increase capacity in that area\n• They could reallocate excess team practice and social activity capacity to 1 on 1 mentorship.

Currently 22 host musicals, 18 host plays, and\n1 hosts a one-person show.\n\nThis case requires the interviewee to\norganize their notes in a way that\nallows them to go back and re-use\nmath to get things done in a quicker\nway. It also calls back to exhibit 1.\nAllow the interviewee to make those\nconnections, but if they ask or are\nstruggling, you can prompt back to\nprevious exhibits.\n\nMarket Growth:\n• Because Broadway theaters are limited in the number of seats available, revenue growth is\nfound primarily in ticket prices.\n• Over the past year, tickets have steadily increased in price by 10%\n• Typical prices are $150/ticket\nClient Characteristics:\n• Their goal is to achieve highest profit margin possible\n• This producing team is very successful – they have launched all three types of shows before, on and off\nBroadway (but have never produced one of these three particular shows before)\nCosts/show\n• The theater’s maintenance fee is $1000/show\n• They will do 8 shows/week\n• More details on costs in Exhibit 1\n• Ideally shooting for 20%+ profit margins\n• The producing company can sell things (i.e. concessions, t-shirts) within the theater\n“Steve Live” is a brand-new production\n\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\n310\n\n\fCenter Stage: Question 1\nQuestion 1:\n• How should the team determine which show the producing team should mount for the summer season?\n\nNotes to Interviewer:\nThis is the framework. Buckets can and should include:\nFinancials\n• Cost to mount each show (paying talent, managing unions,\ntheater maintenance, marketing, staff, ushers, rights to use\nthe work)\n• Projected revenues (how many tickets, how many\nperformances, % tickets sold, discounts)\n\n•\n•\n\nMarket\nHow are comparable shows doing, especially in the\nsummer months\nWhat are their costs/revenues\n\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\nProducing Team\n• What are their strengths\n• Potential synergies between existing shows\n• Do they have relationships to lean into?\nThe Show\n• Award eligibility?\n• Is it well-regarded, popular, and desirable to see?\nRisks\n• What are the risks of mounting a Broadway show for only 10 weeks?\n• How likely are ticket sales projections?

They’re now focused on figuring out how to price tickets. Your team has\nconducted a survey among theater goers and has produced the following chart (Exhibit 2). How much should tickets be priced to maximize the\nproducing team’s revenues?\n\nNotes to Interviewer:\nRefer to Exhibit 2.\nMissing Data: All unsold tickets will be sold for $50 at the box office starting 2 hours before the show\nIf full price ticket is $100:\n(500)*(.8) = 400 tickets @ $100 = 40000\n(500)*(.2) = 100 tickets @ $50 = 5000\n• Total Revenue: $45000\n\nIf full price ticket is $150:\n(500)*(.6) = 300 tickets @ $150 = 45000\n(500)*(.4) = 200 tickets @ $50 = 10000\n• Total Revenue: $55000\n\nIf full price ticket is $200:\n(500)*(.4) = 200 tickets @ $200 = 40000\n(500)*(.6) = 300 tickets @ $50 = 15000\n• Total Revenue: $55000\n\nInsight: The $150 and $200 options yield the same expected revenue.

If they\nindicate that the acquisition is not possible because they do not have $90B, remind them to check the objective (taking control, not acquiring 100% of shares), and ask how\nmuch money they need.

        "content": "Exhibit 2, how can Hoffmann acquire Technologene?\n\nNotes to Interviewer:\nCorrect approach: Candidate should realize that they need to calculate the capital required of acquiring 25% of shares through Technologene insiders first. This can be\ncalculated as:\n\n• Capital required to purchase from insiders = (per share Price) * (total # of shares) * 25% = $110 * 1B* 25% = $27.5B\nThe candidate should recognize that Hoffmann cannot afford to purchase shares at this price (over $24B budget) and should evaluate another option. If they suggest buying\nentirely from passive investors or entirely from the competitor, before they do any math, ask them if they could achieve their objective that way (they can't, as each group\nowns under 25% of Technologene shares). When the candidate recognizes this, inform them that they can purchase from multiple groups at the prices given. From here, the\ncandidate can take one of two approaches:\n1. Buy majority from passive investors. This is the safe, logical option, as passive investors will sell without issue. We expect most candidates will choose this option.\n• 24% from Passive Investors + 1% from Insiders = ($95/share * 1B shares * 24%) + ($110/share * 1B shares * 1%) = $23.9B (In Budget) 🡨 tell the candidate that\nincluding our fees, this will take up the entirety of the $24B budget\n2. Buy majority from the competitor. If the candidate suggests doing this ask them if they think the competitor will sell their stake, and unless they reach the following\nconclusion, send them back to approach one and continue to Q5. While intuition might suggest the competitor should not sell, in reality it is in the competitor’s best\ninterest to sell because if Hoffmann purchases 51% of the shares, the competitor is denied any influence in the company, and because Hoffmann can reach 51% with or\nwithout the competitor, they should sell rather than be left holding 20% of a company they cannot influence.\n• 20% from Competitor + 5% from Passive Investors = ($90/share * 1B shares * 20%) + ($95/share * 1B shares * 5%) = $22.75B (In Budget)\nWe expect very few candidates to reach this conclusion but give them kudos after the case if they do and explain it to them if they don’t!\n\n© 2024 NYU Stern MCA\n\n325\n\n\fPharmageddon:"
