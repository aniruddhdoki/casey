Introduction
We proudly present the NYU Stern Management Consulting Association’s 2024 casebook. This document is meant to provide a brief
overview of the case interview process, industry overviews, casing tools, and a series of practice cases. For each case, we have
specified the case type and concepts tested, difficulty level, and industry. Some cases are also specific to certain formats used by the
various firms.
We highly encourage you to practice with fellow MBA1s as well as MBA2s, as this method best simulates the case interview process.
We have updated the industry overview sections of this casebook based on the most recent information available. The materials in
this casebook are intended to provide a starting point for interview preparation, and we encourage you to build upon the information
by doing your own research on industries and engaging with firms to gain a deeper understanding of their practices.
Best of luck in the upcoming recruiting season!

Case Types and Interview Methods
▪

What is a case?
o A business issue/problem company is facing in a few sentences
o Takes about 25 minutes; has limited data which is usually provided if asked for
o Approach to solution is more important than the final solution

▪

There are two common case interview methods:
o “Go with the flow” (typical of most firms) – You will determine which areas to explore and lead the
discussion, i.e. drive the case
o Command and control (typical of McKinsey) – Interviewer guides the discussion and case has heavy
brainstorming components and quantitative work

Get the facts right – ask clarifying questions
o Make 100% sure that you understand the objective: e.g. if the objective is to be
the market leader, clarify what this means (highest market share, revenue, profit?)

▪

Summarize the essence of the problem
o Do not just repeat all the facts back to the interviewer

▪

Draw out your approach to solving the problem (i.e. framework)
o Try to include at least 2 levels of depth in your framework
o Customize your framework to the case
o Be MECE

▪

Walk your interviewer through your framework

Remember: since every case is unique, don’t try to force fit standard frameworks!

Casing Math
Numbers to Know
Casing math is one of the essential
skills to master. While the specific mathematics
are rarely complex, quick recognition, shortcuts,
and application of key concepts are essential to
progressing efficiently and saving time to focus
on other aspects of the case.

• Multiplication Table up to 20 * 20
• Be particularly familiar with perfect squares
• Division rules
• Be comfortable working with percentages

What follows is a list of common
concepts and constants that you should become
familiar with. The list is by no means exhaustive
but will provide a solid foundation for you to
begin building speed and accuracy.

.1111

Finally, one of the most common
mistakes made is with orders of magnitude. Find
the way that most makes sense for you to keep
track of zeros as they can make or break a case.
For some, it’s scientific notation while others
prefer simply using letters.

Casing Math: Market Sizing
Market Sizing Approach

Common Market Sizing Constants

Market sizing is a common case interview
component as it tests your structure, creativity, estimation
skills, and mathematics. Familiarize yourself with the two
most common approaches: top-down and bottom-up. Then
follow this methodology:

•
•
•
•

US Population: 320 M
NYC Population: 8 M
US Households: 120 M
Average number of people per household: 2.5

•

•
•

US Life Expectancy: 80 years
US Population Growth (CAGR): ~0.7%

•
•
•

US GDP: 19T
US GDP CAGR: ~2%
Median Household Income: ~$60,000

•
•
•
•

Europe Population: 740 M
Asia Population: 4.4 B
Africa Population: 1.2 B
Global Population: 7.4 B

•

•

•

Lay out the problem before doing any multiplication
•
Structure the items you need, and how they’ll
interact (addition, multiplication, division, etc.)
•
Don’t make it more complicated that it has to be
Make and state assumptions. Be open to feedback
from your interviewer and adjust if necessary.
•
Try to pick numbers that are easier to work with
Always gut check your answer
•
There are wrong answers. If your sizing feels off,
go back and challenge your assumptions.
•
If the number makes sense, don’t stop there.
Make an insight and drive the case forward.
Market sizing questions can appear as part of a larger
case or as the case itself
•
Recognizing the context of the question will help
to inform the complexity of your approach

Always remember the scope of the market you are sizing
(e.g., US vs Global) and never forget the units you are
solving for!

Banking and Financial Services
Overview: Industry offers services like lending, insurance, and securities management
•
•
•
•

Types of banks: commercial banking, retail banking, investment banking
Products include credit cards, mortgages, loans, insurance, and checking/savings accounts
Customers can be segmented by income levels, individual vs small business vs large business
Highly competitive: international and national players compete with regional banks and new online banks

Revenue Drivers:

Cost Drivers:

• Interest on loans (different loans include real estate, auto, etc.)
• Fixed or Variable Fees (trading commissions, M&A fees, asset
management fees, transaction fees, currency exchange)
• Premiums – credit card APRs
• Credit Cards
• Carry (% above hurdle rate of return for wealth management)

•
•
•
•
•
•

Important Considerations / Trends:

Risks:

• Use of AI / Blockchain to verify transactions
• Decentralized Finance as an alternative to traditional banking for investing
& loans
• Growth of mobile banking; disruption in the industry from Fintech and
online banks
• Changing customer acquisition model – increased emphasis on
relationship building with customers
• Changes in customer demographics creating a larger market for
retirement products

• Change in savings behavior
• Loan defaults, interest rates, federal funds rates
• Regulations within the industry (e.g., Dodd-Frank increased capital
requirements for banks

24

Consumer confidence
Household debt and disposable income
Employment statistics
Government Regulation and interest rates
Urbanization and home purchases

Retail
Overview: Industry consists of department stores, wholesale retailers, discount stores, speciality retailers, and online retailers. Amazon and other online
retailers caused major disruption in the industry by lowering operating costs and passing savings to customers.
Technology also reduced bargaining power of retailers as customers can easily compare prices online.

Revenue Drivers:

Cost Drivers:

• Traffic (foot / online)
• Conversion rate (visits vs purchases)
• Basket size (driven by consumer spending)
• Avg. price per item
• Margin retailer makes vs. distributor vs. manufacturer
• Other revenue (e.g., after sales services)
Key Metrics:
•
Sales per square foot
•
Inventory turnover

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Total revenue = traffic * conversion rate * basket size * avg. price per
item

Important Considerations / Trends:
• Seasonality is a big factor in retail sales – large portion of sales occur in
holiday season / end of year
• Social media presence has a large impact on brand strength and perceptions,
especially with growth of influencers
• Omnichannel retail is growing through e-commerce development or
acquisition, and will soon be the dominant strategy
• More private label products (i.e. Walmart brand instead of manufacturer
brand) and consumers are more receptive to them
• Use of data gathering to tailor the shopping experience – added focus on
customer experience and personalization
• Co-branding has grown in popularity to bolster two seemingly unrelated
brands (i.e. Doritos Locos Taco)

Risks:
• Industry is very impacted by economic conditions (e.g., disposable
income)
• Supply chain issues
• Easy entry invites competition

Key Economic Drivers:
• Consumer Confidence Index
• Per capita disposable income, households > $100,000 income, etc.
• GDP, Inflation

•

Sales direct to consumer (higher margins)
Sales to retailers (lower margins)
Shelf placement in stores
Packaging and price tiering
Product mix (cannibalization vs. complementary products)
Acquisitions

Important Considerations / Trends:
• Discounts and price promotions have lowered margins
• Cannibalization can be a concern when introducing new products, so
firms regularly rationalize brands
• Customer preferences (and marketing materials) shifting towards
sustainability
• Tariffs and regulations play a role in imports / exports and where the firm
is manufacturing or sourcing
• Small firms compete via specialization or local targeting
• High buyer power for retailers (e.g., Walmart)
• Demand has recently increased for organic / socially minded companies
• In-store experiences are one way to increase direct to consumer sales

Cost of goods sold (raw materials)
Manufacturing facilities (owned or leased)
Packaging
Distribution & inventory management
Marketing
R&D – new product innovation
Environmental and regulatory costs
Durables – spoilage

Risks:

• Extensive competition impact on margins
• Changes in consumer trends and tastes

Key Economic Drivers:
• GDP Growth
• Consumer confidence index

26

Technology
Overview: Includes online services (security, productivity, platforms – Google, Amazon, Dropbox), hardware (computers, smartphones, servers – Apple,
Samsung, Lenovo), software (search, storage – Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe). Key customer segments include: large companies, small/medium businesses,
retail/consumers.

Revenue Drivers:

Cost Drivers:

Online services
• Ad revenue (especially for free services)

Healthcare Providers (hospitals, nursing homes)
Overview: The industry consists of facilities, distributors, and service providers (e.g. hospitals, emergency care
facilities, clinics, nursing homes, pharmacies). Rising healthcare costs in the US.

Revenue Drivers:

Cost Drivers:

• Collections from third party payers (i.e.
insurance companies)
• Co-payments for diagnostic tests, consultations, and
treatments
• Government re-imbursement (~50% of spend)
• Payments from uninsured patients
Key Metrics:
• Patient Volume
• Level of Care Required
• Reimbursement Rates

• High upfront investment in hospital facilities
and equipment
• Physicians (i.e. doctors & nurses)
• Medical suppliers
• Treatment Costs
• SG&A
• Other labor
• Utilities (electricity running 24/7)
• Administrative technology costs (e.g., medical record
keeping)

28

Healthcare Payers (insurance companies)
Overview: Industry provides insurance coverage to both companies and individuals. Insurance is heavily based on
risk measurement and forecasting the inflows and outflows of cash. It is primarily divided into two classifications: life
insurance and non-life insurance.

Revenue Drivers:

Cost Drivers:

• Insurance premiums
• Government subsidies
• Investment returns

• Payouts to healthcare providers – insurance
companies often negotiate directly with healthcare
providers on reimbursement rates; billed price is
typically paid at a discount
• Reinsurance
• Labor
• Technology (e.g., claims management technology)
• SG&A

Key Metrics:
• Premiums paid by policyholders
• Fee income

Important Considerations / Trends:
• Digital transformations for consumers
• Industry has been affected by healthcare reform – increases in bottom line due to pressure to eliminate / lower coverage
caps, reduce denials based on pre-existing conditions, and increase in insured population
• Firms differentiate based on broader network coverage, lower administration fees, steeper discounts on provider charges, and
add-ons (e.g., case management)
• Price comparisons occur on exchanges / online marketplaces
• Emerging tech in claims management (e.g., Lemonade) makes digital-first insurance providers user-friendly and expedient
• Highly regulated industry

29

Life Sciences / Pharma
Overview: Industry encompasses originator drug producers, generic drug manufacturers and pure R&D firms.
Customers can be doctors / providers or patients.It can take years to get a new drug approved and on the market.
Companies often expand by acquiring a smaller company with a promising drug. Experimental drugs have to typically pass
three phases of trials, with a 80%, 30%, and 30% success of passing each (0.8*0.3*0.3 total chance of success)

Revenue Drivers:

Cost Drivers:

• Drug sales – difference in price comes from OTC /
prescription drugs
• 3rd party payer reimbursement
• Government subsidies

• High R&D
○
Suck cost of drug is not approved
• Regulatory and legal costs (e.g., patents, FDA)
• Manufacturing and production
• Distribution and sales
• Labor

Key Metrics:
• # of patented drugs
• Market sizing: total population 🡺 % with illness 🡺
% diagnosed 🡺 market share of drug 🡺 price of
one dose * # of doses per year

Important Considerations / Trends:
•
•
•
•
•

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

High growth in emerging markets
Patents protect drugs for up to 20 years
First mover advantage is real
FDA approvals last 5 years with a high failure rate of drugs – many drugs fail during three phases
Increasing demand for pricing transparency

30

Airlines
Overview: Two types: cargo and commercial. Within commercial airlines segments include international vs national vs regional, and
low cost vs legacy carriers. Two main traveller types: leisure (price sensitive) vs business (price inelastic). Industry faces extensive price
competition and government regulation.

Oil & Gas
Overview: Oil & Gas is a stage based industry. Majority of market share tied to upstream
operations.
• Upstream: Drilling and extracting raw oil (usually contracted out)
• Midstream: Transporting the raw oil
• Downstream: Refining and selling the finished petroleum products

Cost Drivers:
Upstream
• Exploration (e.g., land leases)
• Rig rates (usually daily) & rig utilization
• Drilling and extraction equipment & labor
Midstream
• Crude oil
• Storage
• Transportation
• Pipeline construction
Downstream
• Crude oil
• Refinery equipment & labor

Revenue Drivers:
• Upstream: Crude oil price

Store layout and shelf placement are huge factors in customer sale

35

Non-Profit
Overview: Non-profit organizations serve the public interest and are exempt from federal income taxes. However, many non-profit
organizations are organized in a similar way to for-profit companies and have a C-suite, Board of Governors, by-laws and annual
meetings. Examples of non-profit organizations include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), charitable organizations, religious
institutions, educational departments and organizations, social workers, health and human services, activists, and community developers.

Revenue Drivers:

• Real estate
• Technology cost (website/app maintenance)

Donations
Funds
Ticket sales (for charity events)
Memberships (for museums or other similar organizations)
Tuition (for educational institutions)
Government subsidies
Endowment returns

Important Considerations / Trends:
• Growing emphasis on companies to incorporate more corporate social responsibility initiatives and non-profit arms into their
organizations
• Growing emphasis on environmentally-conscious initiatives and sustainability
• Firms are often evaluated by donors on metrics related to what percentage of profit goes towards cause (vs. Reinvestment in
the non-profit)

Private Equity
Overview: Private Equity (PE) firms are a source of investment capital for companies. They purchase private companies or acquire
public companies to make them private, often using large amounts of debt. The goal of a PE firm is to invest in companies, create
value through margin expansion, revenue growth etc., and then exit via sale, IPO, etc. to generate returns for their investors
("LPs"). PE Firms make money via fees and carried interest. Examples include Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group, KKR, etc.

Revenue Drivers:

Cost Drivers:

• Fees on committed capital (0-3%, average 2%)
• Carried Interest – % of interest kept by PE firm after
hurdle rate (target investment return of LPs) is
exceeded
• Other consulting/advisory services
• Portfolio companies can cover all industries but may enjoy
revenue through cross-selling with other portfolio companies
Key Metrics:
• EBITDA / Cash EBITDA
• Revenue

•
•
•
•
•

Deal Fees
Salaries
Overhead costs
Due Diligence
Portfolio companies can cover all industries but have very
large interest expenses from the loans utilized to take the
company private

Important Considerations / Trends:
• Two main types of PE firms: active (give operational support to management and increase synergies) and passive (depend on
management to grow company)
• Exit opportunities include selling its position to a competing firm or M&A with another company, putting its private
companies up for IPO, or shutting down and selling off assets
• PE firms create value through deal origination and execution, and through portfolio oversight and management
• Typical target companies for PE firms are sourced through networks of high-ranking partners and based on investment theses
for value creation
• Venture Capital is similar to Private Equity but targets young companies and value revenue over profitability. VC does not use
debt to finance acquisitions (e.g., startups / early stage)

•
Brainstorming

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

• Even though the case is ostensibly interviewer-led, a great candidate should be able
to identify the path the case should take from the case prompt and client goal and
drive the case towards a profitability analysis, feasibility considerations, and risk
factors.

41

*Quant indicates how much math is involved and Structure represents the level
of difficulty around developing frameworks. 1 = Easiest, 10 = Hardest

One Man’s Trash: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:
Waste management companies usually
collect and/or process waste. They often own
and operate landfills. Their primary sources
of revenues are fees from collecting trash or
allowing others to dump trash at their sites.
●
The hard drives were accidentally discarded
by the original purchasers of the
cryptocurrency coins and contain the private
keys that allow anyone to access and trade
the coins.
• Gremlin Services became aware of this
opportunity through a news story covering
accidentally discarded cryptocurrency
• Gremlin Services wants an annual profit of at
least $4M to pursue this opportunity.

One Man’s Trash: Question 2
Math Question:
• Gremlin Services is considering two potential approaches to searching and recovering hard drives: the first is using their existing
excavators tech and the second is investing in new AI scanning technology. Which of these two options should they pursue?

Math Solution:

Math Information:

• Candidates should calculate annual profit and payback periods but are missing
some of the information to do so, see “Math Information”.

All information needed for calculations can
be found on Exhibit 1 and below. Give the
following information when asked:

Existing Tech:
Revenues = 75,000 tons of waste * 1 hard drive/ton * ⅔ chance successful recovery *
0.5 cryptos/drive * $500 average crypto price = $12.5M
Costs = $8M annual maintenance + $0.5M annual labor = $8.5M
Profit = $12.5M - $8.5M = $4M
Payback period = $10M setup cost / $4M profit per year = 2.5 years
AI Scanner:
Revenues = 40,000 tons * 1 * 75% * 0.5 * $500 = $7.5M
Costs = $1.2M + $0.3M = $1.5M
Profit = $7.5M - $1.5M = $6M
Payback period = $12M/$6M = 2 years

45

• Average # of crypto per drive: 0.5
• Average price of crypto: $500

One Man’s Trash: Question 3
Brainstorming #2:
• What are some of the risks Gremlin Services should consider about this opportunity?
• Note: If the candidate has already discussed risks in their framework, or if time remains, ask them to come up with additional risks, dive
deeper into the ones they’ve already listed, assess the severity or priority of risks, or discuss ways to mitigate risks.

Notes to Interviewer:
• Some risks are:
○
Technological
■
Recovery success rate
■
Technological limitations
■
Data corruption
○
Financial
■
Cost overruns or unanticipated costs
■
High volatility of cryptocurrency
markets
■
Potential low yields of viable drives

○

○

Environmental
■
Disruption to local ecosystems
■
Site damage or long-term land instability
■
Hazardous materials exposure
■
Environmental regulation compliance
Reputational
■
Negative PR
■
Pushback from government partners,
investors, or community leaders

• A good candidate should anticipate discussing risks without prompting and should be structured with at least 5 ideas.

Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• Move forward with the opportunity
since it meets the client’s goal of at
least $4M in annual profit.

• Note: Candidates can choose any
risk from the brainstorm they
completed for Question #3 but should
tie the specific risk to their next steps.

• Explore site selection criteria
• Test proof of concept with a pilot
project
• Look into technology partners or
in-house resources to build scanning
tech
• Explore potential regulatory
limitations

• Invest in AI scanning technology to
search & recover the lost
cryptocurrency, which is expected to
bring in $6M/yr and with a 2 year
payback period.

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• Stay structured throughout and drive the case through feasibility, profitability, risks, and potential alternatives even though the
case is interviewer-led
• Keep in mind the client’s annual profit target
• Be structured and creative in their brainstorming and consider a wide range of factors
• Notice that many of the risks are substantial and could make the opportunity unfeasible or highly unprofitable

The Pricing Games
Authors: Will Wang (Stern ‘19), Di Mo (Stern ‘19) Firm Round & Case Style: BCG Round 1
[Interviewer-led]

Quant: 5
Structure: 7

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
Your client is Next Level Gaming (NLG), a start-up in the E-sports and computer gaming industry based in Los Angeles, California. NLG is
planning to launch its first game – an online, multiplayer role playing game that is unlike any existing franchise. Being a new player in the
industry, NLG’s CEO, Bobby Beck, has asked for your help in deciding its business model. The company is considering 3 alternatives: a
subscription model where players pay a monthly fee; a retail model where players pay full price at initial purchase, and a free-to-play
model where the game is free to play but charges players for in-game merchandise. How would you advise NLG to proceed?

Case Overview:

Overview Information for Interviewer:

Industry: Technology

• The case will test the candidate on 3 concepts:
o Market sizing. The case starts by asking the candidate to
estimate addressable market size in # of players
o Profitability calculations. Candidate will be asked to calculate profitability
under each of the 3 business models
o Brainstorming. The case concludes by asking for qualitative factors
to determine the optimal launch strategy

The Pricing Games: Case guide
Clarifying Information:

Interviewer Guide:

•

Time frame: NLG is looking to launch immediately.

•

•

Competition: The online gaming industry is dominated by 3
major players who control 35%, 25%, and 20% share
respectively. There is a long tail of smaller gaming companies.

•

Target Market: Based on preliminary market research, NLG
expects the majority of players to be between the ages of 21 to
40.

•

Geography: NLG is planning to launch its game in the US
only.

A Good Framework Will Mention:
o
Break down drivers of profitability for each of the 3
business models
• Consider # of players acquired and $ revenue per player
• Consider fixed and variable costs including infrastructure
(fixed) and customer acquisition (variable)
o
Factor in qualitative factors for each business model
• Consider potential competitive responses
• Consider customer acquisition costs and long-term
retention rate of player base
• Explore other sources of income such as merchandising

•

Competitive response: what if a new competitor launches a game in the same genre? How sticky is NLG’s player
base when faced with competition?
Growth potential: is there an opportunity for NLG to expand its product offering to attract more players? Potential paths
for growth include:
• New platform: expanding from PC to mobile or console
• New geography: expanding outside of US
• New game: launching 2nd generation game to create new content for players
Alternate revenue streams: can NLG explore alternate revenue streams such as merchandising? Can NLG participate
in E-sports tournaments (contingent on reaching a large enough player base)
Consumer preference changes: will more players migrate to non-PC platforms such as mobile? Will a new generation
of players lose interest in our game genre?

52

The Pricing Games: Chart Interpretation
Question #4: Qualitative Brainstorm
How does this information impact your outlook on the 3 different business models? [Show Exhibit 3].
After the candidate has processed the chart, push for a final recommendation.

Notes to Interviewer:

•

Exhibit 3 contains qualitative information that candidates can use to guide their final recommendation.

•

If the interviewee is unfamiliar with “Beta tests” in the video games industry, inform them that it is part of NLG’s market research to offer early trial
experience to a select group of players

•

Interviewee should realize that a higher value is not favorable for the last survey question

•

Interviewee should note that the retail model would have low customer loyalty and low potential for additional revenue. The free-to-play and
subscription responses indicate high levels of customer loyalty.

•

A strong interviewee would comment on the statistical relevance of the survey as it has 100 responses, a statistically significant amount

The Pricing Games: Recommendation
Recommendation, Risks & Next Steps
• NLG’s CEO, Bobby Beck, wants to meet for lunch to discuss your findings. How would you summarize your recommendation?

Recommendation:
• The candidate may recommend either the subscription or the free-to-play business model. A strong candidate will display
consistency based on his or her brainstorm from Q3 and cite relevant insights to support the recommendation, along with
mentioning profit margins (if calculated) A strong candidate should also recognize short and intermediate-term risks and
suggest tangible methods for mitigation.
• An example recommendation:
o

“I recommend for NLG to pursue the free-to-play business model. This model captures the largest player base which
puts NLG in a strong position against competitive threats. It also allows NLG to launch future games, expand to
new geographies, or move into other platforms such as console or mobile. Even though short-term financial benefits
are equivalent to that of subscription, the free-to-play model puts NLG in a more competitive position long-term.”

o

“Key risks associated with free-to-play model is generating a sufficient percent of paying players and growing revenue per
player. To mitigate this risk, I recommend designing two types of in-game purchases. Players can either pay to “beautify”
in- game characters to improve aesthetic appeal; or, players can pay to expedite the levelling journey and save time from
“grinding” through stages. These efforts will help NLG capture a sufficient segment of paying customers based on two
sustainable value propositions.”

Authors: Natalie Ashbridge, Cortne Edmonds, Stan Tunstall (Stern ‘21) Firm Style & Round: BCG Round 1
[Interviewee-Led]

Quant: 4
Structure: 7

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
Our firm has just wrapped up a project with The Stance School, which offers K-12 education in Philadelphia, to help them
with developing two major strategic initiatives. The first initiative, which is the priority, is an e-learning platform for their
students to facilitate remote learning, in response to a global pandemic that resulted in students having to take classes from
home for the last few months of the school year. The other initiative is a professional development tool to help the teachers
with developing and effectively providing a remote curriculum to the students. The team that worked on the strategic
planning determined that the cost would be $1M. You are now tasked with determining how these initiatives will be funded
within the next year and whether or not the school should move forward with this project.

Case Overview:

Overview Information for Interviewer:

Industry: Education (Public Sector)

This case can also be given in an interviewer-led style, following the math and exhibit question order. However, in
an interviewee-led case, it will likely flow this way naturally.

Case Type: Reducing Costs
Concepts Tested:
• Accounting
• Brainstorming
• Creativity

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

Interviewee should be able to…
• Identify the major sources of funding and expenses for a school
• Complete basic math efficiently
• Maintain structure and rigor throughout the brainstorms that flow out of the funding analysis
Key case steps:
• Determine proper levers to pull for school funding and drive in a logical direction
• Evaluate revenue and cost through a pro-forma income statement and quantify cost-savings from provided data
• Assess qualitative risks and challenges of cost-cutting and implementation

Clarifying Information:
•

•

•

•

Timeframe
• Currently it is 2020 H1 (First Half)
• The initiatives will be launched at the start of
the 2020-2021 school year
• The last income statement we have is from FY
‘18
School Details
• The school is a private school in a major
metropolitan city in the US
• The school consists of a lower and upper
school, educating levels K-12
Student Demographics
• There are 1000 students in the school
• Students are primarily middle-upper middle
class
Funding Questions
• ~10% of the students are on scholarship
• No need to consider ongoing costs for the
program. With the $1M in savings per year, that
should also cover ongoing run-rate of the
initiatives.
• Endowment is allocated for specific purposes
and to ensure that the school is funded in the
long-term. The endowment would not be an
option for funding the initiatives.

•

Necessary Information that should be given only when specifically asked for by
interviewee:
o
To evaluate profitability of the school (Provide Exhibits 1 & 2
Exhibit 1 – Pro Forma Income Statement
together)▪
▪
Exhibit 2 – Historical Tuition Data across Competitor Schools
o
To calculate cost-savings from staff
salaries ▪
Exhibit 3 – Roles, Salaries, Headcount, and Benchmark against Competitor
Schools
▪
Exhibit 4 – Specific Roles, Salaries, Headcount, and Goal Headcount

•

Additional Guidance / Case Flow
o
After the initial structure, guide candidate to understand the school’s revenue and
expenses and explore internal funding opportunities (faster to achieve given timeframe)
o
Provide exhibits 1 and 2 together
o
After reviewing exhibits 1 and 2, guide candidate to evaluate costs (specifically salaries)
if the candidates does not arrive there on their own
o
Provide exhibit 3 and have them determine where they see opportunities
o
If the candidate notices the salary total on Exhibit 1 differs from the total of
salaries on Exhibit 3. This is because the income statement line item item
includes additional benefits offered, which is usually ~50% of the annual salary
for a role. The candidate likely won’t as that math is long and beyond the scope
of the question
o
Provide exhibit 4 with specific roles outlined by the school and have them calculate the
savings
o
Conduct the brainstorming questions (can be done interviewer-led, if necessary)
o
Wrap up with conclusion

Stance at a Distance: Math Question 1
Math Question:
• What conclusions or insights can be drawn from examining The Stance School and its competitors’ line items?

Math Solution:

Math Information:

Evaluation Criteria:
• Poor Candidate: Attempts to compare expense items in absolute terms. Candidate rounds
expense items aggressively and doesn’t offer any deeper insights after figuring out which
expenses are out of line with competition.
• Good Candidate: Examines exhibits 1 and 2 and comes to the conclusion that Stance needs to
focus on cutting costs rather than topline growth. Works through math quickly and offers insight
into why they’d like to know more about salaries.
• Great Candidate: In addition to what the good candidate does, they drive the case by asking for
specific additional information such as average salary by job function, headcount, or staff growth
rates (to compare to enrollment growth from exhibit 2).

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

61

• Candidates should examine exhibit 2
and realize that the school can not raise
tuition without impacting enrollment.
• Exhibit 1 informs them that Stance is not
eligible for additional grants (Footnote 1).
• All expenses are a proportion of Tuition &
Fees (Footnote 2).
• If candidates round within reason, they
should still reach the conclusion that
salary expenses are out of line with
competitor schools, in addition to being
the highest line item
• Scholarships are the second largest
expense. If candidates consider reducing
scholarships, inform them that Stance will
receive significantly less grant funding
than they currently receive.

Stance at a Distance: Math Question 2
Math Question:
• The school has determined that these would be the positions they would look to reduce to be able to reallocate funds for the
initiatives. Calculate annual cost savings if the school were to match the benchmark ratio of students to position for these 5
positions (refer to Exhibit 4)

Math Solution:

Math Information:
• Number of Students in the School: 1000
• Funding Goal: $1M

The school will be short of it’s $1M goal by $90,000
Evaluation Criteria:
•
•
•

Poor Candidate – Will struggle with the math; this is basic division, subtraction, and multiplication
so the candidate should go through the math smoothly
Good Candidate – Will determine how much will be saved by matching the benchmark number of
roles per student that can be reallocated to the initiatives.
Great Candidate – Will say the above and will also move into brainstorm 1 naturally (considering
risks and potential costs that would be incurred from cutting these positions)

62

Stance at a Distance: Brainstorm 1
Brainstorm 1:
• What are the potential risks and associated costs that you anticipate when eliminating these roles?

Notes to Interviewer:
Interviewer should prompt candidate to do this brainstorm if they don’t do it on their own following the calculations and analysis of exhibit 4
Common Responses:
• Financial Costs
•
Severance costs
•
Pension costs
•
Union negotiations
• Non-Financial Costs:
•
Time frame to be able to eliminate roles and how that impacts annual budget/funding
•
Negative PR associated with lay-offs
•
Potential decline in enrollments
•
Negative outcomes for mental health of the student population
Evaluation Criteria:
• Poor Candidate: Laundry list with no structure
• Good Candidate: Structured, but only gets 4-5 ideas and no creative ideas
• Great Candidate: Structured, with at least 9 ideas and 1-2 ideas that are creative/unique to the candidate

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

63

Stance at a Distance: Brainstorm 2
Brainstorm:
• What are some ways that The Stance School could close the funding gap in order to reach the $1M goal?

Notes to Interviewer:
Common Responses:
• Lobby for additional appropriations from the state
• License the teacher training platform or student learning platform to other schools
• Offer remote tutoring or additional classes on the platform for a fee
• Solicit donations from students, parents, alumni, or other external parties
• Target high net worth alumni to donate a gift (offer rooms or awards named after them)

Evaluation Criteria:
• Poor Candidate: Laundry list with no structure
• Good Candidate: Structured, but only gets 4-5 ideas and no creative ideas
• Great Candidate: Structured, with at least 9 ideas and 1-2 ideas that are creative/unique to the candidate

Stance at a Distance: Recommendation
Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• Move forward with project:
• Eliminate the 5 roles, resulting in
$910K of savings per year
• Additional funding can be sourced
through alternative routes to make
up for the remaining $90K/year

• Negative PR from lay-offs
• Decline in enrollments due to
reduced student-staff ratios
• Negative performance implications
(unlikely as this role is not as
student-facing as the teacher
roles)

• Ensure no negative impact to
enrollments, which impact revenue
• Start contract reviews and process of
eliminating roles to finalize budget
and savings reallocation for next
school year

• Do not move forward with project
• Role elimination will not generate
1M; school needs to get in line with
benchmarks before it moves forward
with any projects

• Missing out on key technology
for teachers and opportunity to
help modernize school
• Negative impacts to school by layoffs of staff

• Conduct in-depth analysis on the
pros and cons of eliminating roles
• See if there are any additional
ways to generate revenue

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• The candidate logically concludes that within a year, the fastest way to funding is through cost-cutting rather than increasing revenue
• When math is done and candidate recognizes that there is a funding gap, the candidate will refer to their original framework to see
if there are other ways to close the gap to move the initiatives forward

Stance at a Distance: Exhibit 3 Notes for Interviewer

Key Insights Interviewer Should Look For:
Candidate may jump into doing math, but the goal is to look qualitatively to determine which positions they would focus on for savings and provide a
rationale. Make sure they focus on roles where the school is: 1) over-hired relative to competitors; and 2) would have minimal impact on the academic
performance of the students.
Evaluation Criteria:
• Poor Candidate: Will pick roles based on what makes the most savings without any qualitative rationale
• Good Candidate: Will note that the school is over indexed in non-educator positions relative to similar school districts and will focus on identifying a
few of those roles that they would want more information
• Great Candidate: Will say the above but also deeper insights: note that there are risks in eliminating these roles and what they are. Will move toward
asking for data that helps them to understand if there is a good number of these roles that a school should have in order to not affect school
performance

The beverage department of a regional supermarket has seen a drop in revenue over the last year and has
hired your firm to determine the cause of the decline and recommend ways to reverse the trend.

Case Overview:

Overview Information for Interviewer:

Industry: Retail

• Interviewer should let the interviewee drive the case and offer up information / exhibits
only when asked.
• The case is a good test of time management of the interviewee. It can be completed in
under 15 minutes.
• A good candidate will remain high level, only drilling down after having determined the
interviewer has the asked-for information and not wasting time where there is no
information.

Case Type: Revenue Growth
Concepts Tested:
• Pricing
• Brainstorming

*Quant indicates how much math is involved and Structure represents the
level of difficulty around developing frameworks. 1 = Easiest, 10 = Hardest

Drinks Gone Flat: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:

Interviewer Guide:

• Client is a leading regional grocer
within the southeastern U.S.

A Good Framework Will:
o Focus on revenue and its levers of price and quantity, staying away from costs
o Contain creative recommended options for brainstorming discussion to reverse
the revenue decline trend
o Incorporate knowledge of existing marketing frameworks such as the 4P’s

• Competitive landscape has not
changed in the last year
• Revenue decline is specifically
within the beverage segment
• Client wants to find the cause of the
declining revenue and
recommendations for how to stop
the decline

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

Necessary Information that should be given only when specifically asked for by
interviewee:
o Exhibit 1
▪ Provide when interviewee asks specifically for revenue / sales numbers
segmented by beverage product category
o Exhibit 2
▪ Provide after interviewee determines revenues are only declining
in sodas and asks for further segmented information by brand

73

Drinks Gone Flat: Interviewer Guide to Exhibit 1

Notes to Interviewer:
• Revenue calculations:
•
Sodas – 2014: 100 x .9 = $90 2015: 120 x .7 = $84
•
Waters – 2014: 20 x .7 = $14
2015: 22 x .65 = $14.3
•
Other – 2014: 11 x 4 = $44
2015: 10 x 4.5 = $45

Change = -$6M
Change = +$0.3M
Change = +$1M

• Interviewee should notice that decline in beverage revenue is only from decline in sodas. This should prompt the
interviewee to drive the case to further segmenting soda revenues

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

74

Drinks Gone Flat: Interviewer Guide to Exhibit 2

Notes to Interviewer:
• Interviewee should notice the decline in revenue for Brand A immediately. Interviewee should also notice the decline in
volume for Brand A and the large increase in volume for the Value Brand. This should prompt the interviewee to calculate the
price change for each of the brands
•
Brand A – 2014 and 2015 price of $1
•
Brand B – 2014 and 2015 price of $1
•
Value Brand – 2014 Price: 15/25 = $0.60; 2015 Price : 24/60 = $0.40

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

75

Drinks Gone Flat: Brainstorming
Question #2:
The client would like to hear your recommendations for how to reverse the decline in revenue of the beverage segment.

Notes to Interviewer:
A great candidate will not need prompting of this question, and will drive the case forward remembering that recommendations
for reversing the declining revenue were a part of the prompt
•
Upon determining that the value brand is causing the overall decline in the beverage segment, a great candidate
will move the case forward with recommendations
Objective for the interviewee would to be able to provide a number of recommendations and stay structured while doing so
•
Possible option would be to organize brainstorming recommendations around 4P’s
• Price
• Promotion
• Product
• Placement

Apple of My Eye: Question 1
Question #1a:
• Bob has decided to explore expansion into cider. Based on his initial research, he has created the following Exhibit (Exhibit 1)
detailing impacts to his current production if he were to undergo renovations to the brewery to accommodate cider production.
What are your thoughts on these two options?

Notes to the Interviewer:
-

Candidate should recognize that there are other ways (building a new factory, buying cider from an existing company and
reselling etc.) to expand into the cider industry outside of renovating the factory.

-

Current State:
-

-

After Renovations:
-

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

Pros: specialization in one product (one clear consistent marketing message, specialized labor force)
Cons: not meeting demand for gluten free customers, not increasing revenue potential

Pros: New product offering, Cider has a higher selling price than beer
Cons: Beer production decreases by 6 cases/day, costs of renovation

Question #1b:
• What will be the change in Bob’s annual revenue if he begins to produce cider?

Math Information:

Math Solution:
• Revenues would increase by $302,400 annually.
• Note: Student can also calculate difference in beer revenue in the future (6 less
cases produced per day; decrease of 20%) and add this to cider production.

(assume 20 days per month)

Apple of My Eye: Question 2
Question #2:
• Besides potential revenue, what other factors should Bob consider before expanding into the cider market?

Notes to Interviewer:
Candidate should quickly identify cost as a key factor, but let them brainstorm other ideas such as those listed below.
• Cost
○
Labor training
○
Equipment
○
Labeling
○
Marketing
○
Raw Materials (apples etc.)
• Market Size / Demand
○

Question #3:
• Bob has determined that he needs to capture at least 0.5% of the NYC take-home cider market annually in order
to break-even. Will he be able to produce enough cider to capture the 0.5%?

Math Information:

Math Solution:
Candidate should be able to use math from previous question to realize that Bob
produces 86,400 bottles per year. For the sake of time, interviewer can provide this
number to candidate if needed.

🡺 15.5 million bottles of cider are
expected to be sold in New
York City next year

• Bob will be able to produce enough bottles to capture the 0.5%

Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• Bob should make the investment to
produce cider. He will see an increase
in revenues of $302,400 per year and
should be able to breakeven based
on his 0.05% calculation.

• What is happening to the cider
market going forward?→ Can
Bob really meet the demand?

• Competitive analysis
• Pressure test Bob’s assumptions
about 0.05%

• Cannibalization of beer products
• Competition in the cider industry

• Market research to determine if
there is a specific price point, flavor
and packaging that will sell best

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• An excellent caser will realize that demand for Bob’s cider has not been considered. While he can produce enough to breakeven,
can he actually sell that amount?
• A great caser will also realize that the calculations in Question 2 can be completed by calculating changes in revenue,
simplifying overall calculation.

Tres Burritos: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:
• There are 10 locations in NYC
• The restaurants sell 3 types of
burritos, along with guacamole,
salsa, and other sides.

Question 1:
• What should they consider in responding to the virus?
• Profitability
• Revenue
• Current - product mix, # of orders, avg check
• New – lost sales impact, # stores closing

• All of their sales come from
grab-and-go takeout orders. Tres
Burritos does not currently offer
delivery.
• Their main goal is maintaining a net
positive profit. They're also
concerned about how their actions
in NY will affect the national brand.
• The virus is projected to last for 3
months
• We do not know how Tres
Burritos is responding in other
cities.

Costs • Fixed – rent, equipment, SG&A, marketing
• Variable – labor, COGS
• Options to Respond
o Stay open
o Close
o Modify
o Offer Delivery, Curbside Pickup, etc.
o Partial closures
o Change hours
o Close only some stores

If the candidate does not have at least
these three options, guide them to think
beyond binary open vs. close.

•

One possible way of structuring the analysis
would be to form a pro and con matrix, but
any structure to the analysis is acceptable.

•

Candidate should conclude that they want to
evaluate the profitability of chosen options.
They should ask if we have any information
on the profitability of each option.
•
Note: Q3 will ask them to
calculate profitability of only one
option.

Tres Burritos: Question 3 – Math
Math Question:
• Governor Andy Hamilton has decided that restaurants cannot stay open as usual – they can only offer delivery. What will
the virus's impact be on Tres Burritos' profitability per location?

The candidate should ask for the current revenue
and costs, and projected impact of the virus.
Read the following to the candidate once
asked:
• Revenue will drop by 10%
• COGS will increase by 10%
• Launching delivery will cost $20,000
for one time to set up

•

Candidate should recall that the virus is
projected to last for 3 months. Calculate EBITDA
for each of 3 months for total profitability impact.

•

Takeaway: while the EBITDA will decrease (and
is negative in month 1), Tres Burritos will still
have positive EBITDA over 3 months by offering
delivery, which is a better outcome than closing
stores altogether.

Tres Burritos: Question 4 – Brainstorm
Question #4:
• What are some possible ways to improve EBITDA if they choose to keep restaurants open and offer delivery?

Notes to Interviewer:
Some answers to improve profitability could include:
• Increase revenue
•
Groceries – offer to sell ingredients from their kitchen directly to customers
•
Partner with other local restaurants to drive traffic
•
Raise prices
•
Increase presence on 3rd party delivery apps to drive sales – Seamless, etc.
• Decrease costs
•
Reduce staff
•
Close some stores
•
Limit menu options
•
Reduce delivery cost of $20k (launch with a service instead of doing on own – Seamless, Caviar, etc.)

Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• Offer delivery for $37,000 EBITDA
over 3 months
• Bonus Points: $370,000 total EBITDA
for all 10 NYC stores, ~60% decline
in EBITDA

• Revenues decline more than
projected
• Customers go to competitors for food
and continue to do so after the virus
• Risk of spreading the disease
through food / delivery people
• Damage the national brand if there
is a problem with Delivery

• Find delivery partner and plan
logistics to launch
• Explore lowering costs
• Learn what Tres Burritos and
competitors are doing in other cities

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• A great candidate will realize that the virus will last for 3 months so the profitability impact will change month-to-month
• Creative solutions to the virus could include selling raw ingredients to local families in need of food, working with 3rd
party delivery partners (Seamless, Caviar, etc.) to cut down on costs, and offering discounts to drive traffic amidst low
sales.

102

Men’s Extra Comfortable Essentials: Question 3
Question:
• How can the firm reach the targets promised to shareholders?

Solution:
• This candidate should immediately recognize that there are two products in 2020 that are below the target gross margin and seek
to eliminate them while being cognizant of the 2020 revenue target.
• Candidate should determine that terminating the Tanks product line would decrease revenue to $287.5M (which is still above the
$240M target) and increase gross margin to $29.5M. This would force the gross margin percentage up to 10.26%
• Candidate should also determine that terminating the Tees product line would decrease revenue to $280M (which is still above the
$240M target) and leave gross margin at $29.5M. This would further increase the gross margin percentage above the 10.5% target
(to
10.54%)

Men’s Extra Comfortable Essentials: Question 4
Question:
• The numbers make sense, but of the remaining two product lines, only socks market share can remain constant (at 15%).
Underwear’s market share must increase from 1% to 10%; what are some ways the firm can attempt to do this?

Solution:
•

•
•

•
•

Candidate should take some time to create a structured brainstorm
Customers
Operations
Segmentation
• Re-tool production lines (focus on underwear products
• Luxury Line (e.g., nicer material)
rather than tees or tanks)
• Legacy “Basics” line; Women’s line of underwear
• Renegotiate supplier contracts
Product Mix 🡺 Boxers, Boxer briefs, Briefs, Athletic
• Potentially look for suppliers outside the US
Marketing
• Logistics considerations (Adjust locations of
• Steal share from Hanes, etc.
warehouses, how products are packaged for
• Introduce new customer 🡺 B2B customers, such as selling
transportation)
to other companies for branding
• Outsource the manufacturing of the apparel
Distribution 🡺 New channels (Grocery stores? Pharmacies?
(increase profitability without market size)
Gas stations? Airports? Special vending machines?)
• Marketing push on Underwear products
E-commerce 🡺 Add-on purchases at checkout with other
brands (e.g., Checking out at Club Monaco website,
buying pair of trousers: “Would you like to add Men’s
Extra Comfortable underwear to your order?”)

104

Men’s Extra Comfortable Essentials: Recommendation
Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• Drop the Tanks and Tees product lines
in order to achieve the margin goal
• Embark on a campaign to increase
market share of Underwear lines (via
new products or a female product
lines)

• Potentially alienate loyal customers
• Cutting product lines could
impact sales of other items,
particularly if customer buys
products together (e.g.,
underwear & socks)
• Taking market share for underwear
could incite competitive response
across in other categories

• Determine messaging internally and
externally about why the product
line cut is made
• Determine target for underwear
expansion
• Determine most efficient way to repurpose equipment and labor from
tanks and tees to socks and
underwear

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• An good candidate will recognize the need to calculate 2020 market size and the need for CAGR
• An excellent candidate will utilized shortcuts for math to eliminate unnecessary steps and quickly identify that the 0% margin
product can be cut to increase corporate margin
• The BEST candidate will recognize the firm name acronym is MECE

Adventure Capital: Question 2
Question #2:
Calculate the total cost of this expedition.

Math Solution:
• Once the interviewee has brainstormed all the correct costs, give them Exhibit #1. They should be able to break down the math
as follows:
• If asked, the interviewer can clarify that the food/lodging # is for the entire group
One time costs (Map/Equipment + Legal + Travel)
• $12K + $10K + (6 x $1,500 x 2) = 40K
Recurring costs (Labor + Food/Lodging)
• ($4K x 5 x 12) + ($10K x 12) = 360K
Opportunity Cost = $100K
Total = $40K + $360K + $100K = $500K

Adventure Capital: Question 3
Question #3:
There are two buyers interested in purchasing the artifact once recovered: a private collector and the historic Beelong Zynna Museum.
The private collector is willing to purchase the artifact for a one-time payment of $4M. The museum has less cash up front, but is willing
to pay you as a percent of exhibit ticket sales revenue. How would you practically calculate the value of the museum’s offer, and which
offer is better?

Math Solution:
How to Calculate
• Use comparable data from similar museum (urban, size, # visitors) after acquiring similar artifact
• Use numbers from comparable museum to calculate exhibit cash flows
• Calculate present value of all future cash flows
Provide the following information to interviewer:
•
Museum Attendance = 900,000 people / year
•
% Attendees that Purchase Exhibit Ticket = 50%
•
Ticket Cost = $10
•
% Owed to Explorer = 10%
If asked, provide the following information:
•
Discount Rate = 15%
•
Growth Rate = 5%
Exhibit Revenue: 900k * 50% * $10 = 4.5M
Explorer Revenue: $4.5M * 10% = $450K
Artifact Present Value: $450k / (15% - 5%) = $4.5M
The Museum is the Better Deal: $4.5M > $4M

111

Adventure Capital: Question 4
Question #4:
Our client has a mixed success rate of retrieving ancient treasures. Given the following information, what is the expected return
on investment?

Math Solution:
How to Calculate
• Expected Value (or ‘weighted average’) of taking on adventure vs. Opportunity Cost (Salary)
Provide the following information to interviewer:
•
Chance of Success = 20%
•
Chance of Failure = 80%
Revenue from Success: $4.5M
Loss from Failure (Cost):$0
Expected Revenue Value: (20% * $4.5M) + (80% * 0)= $900K
Worth Pursuing? $900k > $100k (opportunity cost) but….
Profit Margin: (900 - 500) / 500 = 400 / 500 < 85% (our required ROI)
Profit Margin: (900 - 500) / 500 = 400 / 500 = 80%

All Night Long: Guide to Exhibit 1
Notes to Interviewer:
•This exhibit will test candidate’s ability to structure math. The candidate should use the chart to calculate how many seats
will be filled during each showtime, and at what ticket price. From there, he/she should solve for the total revenues from
ticket sales PER NIGHT.
• Reminder: Tickets - $15 Adults, $10 Children/Seniors. Experience offered for 3 nights
One potential approach is below:
Ticket Rev. @ time = (# seats) * [(% children)*($ children) + (% adults)*($ adults) + (% seniors)*($ seniors)]
@ 12:00 AM = 300 * [(30%)*($10) + (60%)*($15) + (10%)*($10)] = 300 * [$3 + $9 + $1] = 300 * 13 = $3,900
@ 3:00 AM = 300 * [(10%)*($10) + (40%)*($15) + (10%)*($10)] = 300 * [$1 + $6 + $1] = 300 * 8 = $2,400
@ 6:00 AM = 300 * [(20%)*($10) + (40%)*($15) + (20%)*($10)] = 300 * [$2 + $6 + $2] = 300 * 10 = $3,000

Total Ticket Revenue = $3,900 + $2,400 + $3,000 = $9,300

A strong candidate will notice that this is only revenue from ticket sales, and that there will also be revenues from
concessions. If asked, provide that average concession revenue is $10 per person. If candidate does not raise this,
ask them about other sources of revenue.
Concessions = $10 * [(300)(100%) + (300)(60%) + (300)(80%)] = $10 * (300 + 180 + 240) = $7,200
Total Revenue under new model = Revenue per night * # of nights = ($9,300 + $7,200) * 3 = $16,500 * 3 = $49,500

All Night Long: Brainstorm Question
Note: The candidate should speculate about other potential costs and benefits of the model. If they don’t and
time permits, ask the below question.

Question:
•

What are some additional factors that our client should consider before making their final decision?

Notes to Interviewer:
• This is a brainstorming exercise where the candidate will have to think big picture about this decision.
• The candidate should consider both internal and external factors, including but not limited to:
•
Potential to cannibalize our current customer base
•
Upfront marketing costs
•
Long-term marketing benefits (word of mouth, additional market share)
•
Whether CNB should roll out to all their theaters or a subset
• Customer/demographic analysis by region
•
What movies should we offer this for – do further market analysis on blockbusters
•
How will competition react to this model? If CNB does not do this, do they lose customers to competition?

All Night Long: Recommendation
Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• CNB Movies should implement this
24-hour experience. The expected
incremental profits are $10,800
(10800/49500 = 22% profit margin)
for one theater.

• CNB’s demand and cost
assumptions may need further
analysis

• Develop marketing strategy

• In addition, offering this experience
gives CNB a competitive
advantage for high-grossing
movies.

• Projections may vary by theater
and geography
• Movies could be a flop

• Sensitivity analysis on demand,
as well as costs
• Look for optimal roll-out strategy
across the US and develop
criteria on which movies to select
for this model as well as which
markets to implement

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• Excellent candidates will drive this entire case themselves and not need course correction. Strong candidates will be creative in
their brainstorming and consider a wide range of internal, external, short-term and long-term factors.

123

*Quant indicates how much math is involved and Structure represents the
level of difficulty around developing frameworks. 1 = Easiest, 10 = Hardest

GGC Health: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:
•

ASCs are modern health care facilities focused on
providing same-day surgical care, including
diagnostic and preventive procedures.

•

ASCs are seen as a more convenient alternative to
hospital-based outpatient procedures.

•

Physicians can perform surgeries at hospitals or
ASCs.

•

Physicians generally dictate where the surgery is
performed.

•

Timeline: ASAP

•

Candidate should recognize that target revenue is
$60M (15% * 400M)

•

Business Model: ASC revenue is equal to the
number of procedures performed in the facility by
the expected reimbursement per procedure.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

GGC Health: Question 1
Question #1 (when candidate asks about expansion):
• I’m glad you brought up external expansion. We have done research and targeted three cities GGC Health could enter: Charlotte,
Indianapolis, and Nashville. The Charlotte ASC location would have 30 doctors, Indianapolis would have 25, and Nashville would
have 16.
• Assuming GGC Health has management capacity to open only one new ASC immediately, can you provide a recommendation
of which city to enter?

Solution:

Information:

• Multiply # of Doctors in each city by breakdown of specialty in each city

•

Give the candidate Exhibit #1

•

The candidate should create their own 3x3
chart and calculate the number of doctors per
specialty per city

•

An excellent candidate will recognize that
Nashville can be immediately eliminated

Information:
• Calculate # of patients/year, then *
by rate to calculate revenue/Dr/year.

• Candidate should identify that
Indianapolis is the most attractive
option, but alone, revenue falls
short of the 15% target ($60M)

GGC Health: Question 3
Question #3:
• Probe the candidate until they identify that Indianapolis does not achieve the desired revenue growth. Once they realize this, ask
them to brainstorm how GGC Health could increase revenues at their current 8 ASC locations?

Notes to Interviewer:
• This is a brainstorm opportunity for the candidate to see how to get the additional $10M needed.
• Candidates should be structured and organized during this brainstorm exercise. Topics should include:
•
Increase the number of patients visiting the ASC
• Increase the number of patients brought in per doctor
• Make ASC preferred place for doctors, by offering more control over the environment, better scheduling,
enhanced
efficiency, and better patient outcomes
• Prioritize high volume doctors
• Provide doctors with a higher share of profits for hitting certain targets
•
Increase the number of doctors per ASC
• New procedures (and new physicians doing those procedures)
• Improved physician outreach (sales/marketing efforts)
•
Product mix
• Prioritize high reimbursement surgeries (that bring in more money per patient)
• Add new high reimbursement surgeries
•
Type of patient: Medicaid/Medicare accepted? Increase patients who get higher reimbursements

127

GGC Health: Question 4
Question #4:
• Our team thinks there is an opportunity to increase the number of doctors per ASC. GGC Health’s ASC sites do not currently offer
urology, but we believe they can add 2 urology doctors to all current ASC sites. Can you calculate the additional revenue from
this?
• Candidate will need to ask for the number of patients. Tell them that each doctor will bring in 8 patients per doctor per month.

Solution:

Information:

• Total number of urologists: 8 sites * 2 urologist/site = 16 urologists
• Total number of patients per year: 16 urologists * (8 patients/doctor/month *
12 months/year) = 1,536 patients
• After calculation tell candidate to round to 1,500
• Total revenue: 1,500 patients * $8,000/surgery = $12M

•

Candidates should still have Exhibit 2
and realize they have the
reimbursement rate.

•

Additional revenue is only applied to
the current 8 ASC sites.

•

Incremental same site revenue plus
new Indianapolis ASC meets $60M
revenue target.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

128

GGC Health: Recommendation
Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• The candidate should articulate that to
meet the revenue target our client
should (1) open a new ASC in
Indianapolis for $49.8M and (2)
increase revenue in current ASC
facilities through adding urology
surgeries for $12M. Candidate can
reference other existing site revenue
growth opportunities identified during
case.

•

• Cost/Benefit analysis for the Indianapolis
location
• If still proves lucrative, begin construction
on new ASC center in Midwest
• Add urology surgeries to current ASC’s
ASAP
• Consider other types of surgeries to add
• Consider expanding into more than
one location in the future

•

•
•
•

No costs were considered in adding a
new facility or procedure
Indianapolis market entry is not on the
east coast and unfamiliar to
management
ASC capacity to accommodate new
surgeries
Not being able to steal expected
market share
Physicians not bringing in expected
number of patients

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• Always keep in mind the goal of the case – to increase revenue by 15% ($60M)
• Eliminate Nashville as an expansion opportunity quickly
• Recognize that opening up one location by itself will not meet the CEO’s revenue targets and independently return to framework
for alternative revenue ideas
• Brainstorm extensive solutions to increase revenue in current ASC’s to demonstrate healthcare knowledge

stores, our client would be the first mover.

• A Good Framework will include the following:
• Financial considerations of pilot
○
Revenue: goods sold, add’l gas sold
○
Upfront costs: R&D/acquisition of technology, store renovations
○
Recurring costs: COGS, technology/technicians, maintenance, utility
○
Opportunity cost
○

Gassy Convenience: Target Market
Question:
What region would be ideal for our pilot?
*Show Exhibit 1*

Clarifications:
• Provide only if asked: Our client’s market share is proportional to the market size.
• Ideally, the Interviewee does not perform calculations, but quickly develops insights. It’s fine if Interviewee does quick mental math for
convenience store revenues.

Key Insights Interviewer Should Look For:
•
•
•
•

Central California can be eliminated right away. Its total annual revenue is very small compared to Northern and Southern California.
Southern California’s convenience store sales is 40% of its total revenue, which is double that of Northern California
Total revenues from Southern California is also higher than that of Northern California.
Conclude that Southern California is the best choice to test the pilot program.

• An exceptional Interviewee would ask about the client’s market share in each of these 3 regions.

Gassy Convenience: Math Question 1
Math Question 1:
To assess the opportunity, we’d like to look at the financials. The team has projected how consumer spending will change in a
just-walk-out store and would like you to estimate the annual profit from goods sold for the just-walk-out store.
*Show Exhibit 2*

Math Solution:

Math Information:

Profit = $40/customer
Quantity = 54,000 customers/year
Annual Profit = $2,160,000

Standard store: $30
• Food: $30 * 50% = $15
• Beverage: $30 * 20% = $6
• Medicine: $30 * 15% = $4.50
• Tobacco: $30 * 15% = $4.50

• A great Interviewee should notice that there is only spending changes for food,
beverages and tobacco, with no increase in spending on medication; total profit has
also increased by 33.3%.
The Interviewee should then ask for information about any other profit sources or costs
to fully understand the financial situation.
At this point, the Interviewer should inform them that due to cost savings from labor
saved and profits from additional gas sales, annual profit for the entire store can be
estimated at $2.5 million.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

136

Just-walk-out store: $40
• Food: $15 * 1.5 = $22.50
• Beverage: $6 * 0.66 = $4
• Medicine: $4.50
• Tobacco: $4.50 * 2 = $9
# customers/day = 150
# days/yr = 360

137

Gassy Convenience: Math Question 2
Math Question:
The client is considering two options for the technology needed for the just-walk-out store: either developing the technology in-house or
partnering with a technology firm. Which type of costs would you consider?

Math Solution:

Math Information:

In-house:
Initial costs = R&D + Set-up = $2.5M + $2M = $4.5M
Annual or recurring costs = Operational + Maintenance = $250K + $250K = $500K

All information to be given as asked for:

Partner:
Initial costs = $3M
Annual or recurring costs = $750K
• A great Interviewee will remember that the pilot is for 3 years. An exceptional Interviewee will
ask if there is a relevant discount rate for this calculation (at this point, you can move on to the
next question).
• Interviewee should recognize that there are initial costs and annual / recurring costs. Any
recommendation should take this into account. Interviewee should use these costs to
calculate the overall expected return of the pilot (move on to next question).

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

138

In-house:
• R&D: $2.5M
• Set-up: $2M
• Annual operational costs: $250K
• Annual maintenance costs: $250K
Partner:
• Set-up: $3M
• Annual partner fee: $750K
Discount rate: 10%

Gassy Convenience: Math Question 3
Math Question:
Calculate whether or not the client would want to invest in the pilot.
*Interviewee should remember that the objective of the pilot is to not lose money, i.e., NPV >= 0*

Math Solution:

Math Information:

NPV = ∑ Total Profits / (1 + r)^t

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

In-house option:
Initial costs = $4.5M
Annual profit = Annual sales profits - annual costs = $2.5M - $500K = $2M
NPV of Pilot Investment = -$4.5M + $2M + $2M / (1+0.1) + $2M / (1+0.1)^2
= -$4.5M + $2M + $1.82M + $1.67M = $1.0M (in-house)
Partner option:
Initial costs = $3M
Annual profit = Annual sales profits - annual costs = $2.5M - $750K = $1.75M
NPV of Pilot Investment = -$3M + $1.75M + $1.75M / (1+0.1) + $1.75M / (1+0.1)^2
= -$3M + $1.75M + $1.6M + $1.45M = $1.80M (partner)
• Interviewee should note that the pilot will make money and that this is in line with the client’s
objectives.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

139

Annual sales profit = $2.5M
In-house initial costs = $4.5M
In-house annual costs = $500K
Partner initial costs = $3M
Partner annual costs = $750K
Discount rate = 10%
Allowable estimates: 1.1^2 = 1.2

• It’s fine if Interviewee only calculates the
NPV for one of the options.
• Once Interviewer has determined
Interviewee’s knowledge of the concept of
NPVs and has showcased mental math
skills, provide the other option’s NPV.

The Rats Don’t Run This City: Question 1
Question #1:
• Historically, rats have caused economic damage to the city in three areas: public health, sanitation, and food waste. Your team has
been asked to calculate the total economic damage done by rats last year in preparation for a budgetary meeting, where our key
stakeholders will be requesting additional funding for this battle. Interviewer to provide the information below.

Notes to Interviewer:
Information to give now:
●
●
●

For every 8,000 rats in the city, there was one additional hospitalization of a citizen due to rat-related diseases.
The city paid 200,000 hours of overtime to sanitation workers to clean up rat droppings and remove available food sources for rats
Restaurants and grocery stores had to dispose of 0.2% of their food that they otherwise would have sold due to contamination from rats

Information only provided upon request:

10,000,000 rats in NYC
Each hospitalization causes $40,000 in economic damage due to increased medical costs and lost productivity
Sanitation workers make $40/hour
Overtime hours are paid at 1.5x the regular hourly rate
Restaurants and grocery stores had a collective $45 billion of food related revenue last year

The Rats Don’t Run This City: Question 1 Solution
Question #1:
• Historically, rats have caused economic damage to the city in three areas: public health, sanitation, and food waste. Your team has
been asked to calculate the total economic damage done by rats last year in preparation for a budgetary meeting, where our key
stakeholders will be requesting additional funding for this battle.

Solution:
Public Health Impact
●
●

Total # of Hospitalizations: 10,000,000 rats ➗ 8,000 rats per hospitalization = 1,250 extra hospitalizations
Total cost of hospitalizations = 1,250 hospitalizations X $40,000 per hospitalization = $50,000,000

Sanitation Impact
●
●

Overtime hourly rate: $40/hr normal rate X (1 + 50%) = $40 X 1.5 = $60/hr overtime rate
Total cost of sanitation = $60/hr overtime rate X 200,000 overtime hours = $12,000,000

Food Waste Impact
●

Total food thrown out: $45 billion in food revenue X 0.2% food wasted = $90,000,000

Total Economic Impact: $50,000,000 + $12,000,000 + $90,000,000 = $152,000,000

The Rats Don’t Run This City: Question 2
Question #2:
• Good news! Based on your economic analysis, the city government has decided to allocate an additional $10M towards rat control.
As the team begins to think about how best to use this money, what factors would you use to evaluate potential mitigation tactics for
the rat problem?

Notes to Interviewer:
• This is meant to test their structure and brainstorming ability. There are a variety of ways they can go, but a sample good response may include:
•
Estimated impact of a potential solution
○
short term % reduction in rat population (extermination)
○
long term % reduction in rat population (sterilization)
○
% reduction in rat-related disease prevalence
○
% reduction in rat-related food waste
•
Costs of the solution
○
labor costs
○
equipment or supply cost
○
opportunity cost
•
Strategic considerations
○
ease of approval from current administration
○
availability of supply for potential solutions
○
ease of administration with current infrastructure
○
implementation timeline
○
public’s perception of solution
○
ability to measure outcomes

The Rats Don’t Run This City: Question 3
Question #3:
• Our team has identified 7 potential projects to further the effort to control rats in the city. How should we proceed?
Interviewer: provide Exhibit 1.

Notes to Interviewer:
• Clarify with candidate that only one project can be in effect at a time and once a project has been completed, it cannot be repeated
• Good candidates should recognize they can eliminate projects Alpha, Delta, Theta, Omega before doing any quantitative analysis.
Interviewer should discourage candidate from calculating impact of those projects and instead prompt them to eliminate some.
○
Alpha has very low safety for humans
○
Delta is over budget
○
Theta has very low safety for the environment
○
Omega is inferior to Epsilon in every single category
• Great candidates should be able to recognize that they can combine projects Beta and Gamma over a 2-year period
• Provide this information to the candidate only when asked: rat population is 10 million, current growth rate is 10% per year, overall
project goal is to reduce rat population by 60% within 2 years (as stated in the initial case prompt)

The Rats Don’t Run This City: Question 3 Solution
Question #3:
• Calculate the % reduction in rat population achieved for the shortlisted projects
[Candidate should be able to recognize that they only need to calculate this for project Epsilon, and the combination of projects Beta and Gamma. If
candidates don’t recognize this, interviewer should push them towards this direction.]

Solution
Impact on rat population each year = population size * (1 - % of exterminated rats) * (1 + % growth rate * (1 - % reduction in the growth rate due to sterilization))
Combination of projects Beta and Gamma
• Starting population = 10 million rats, Annual growth rate of population = 10%
• Year 1: Project Beta
○
10 mil * (1 - 50%) * (1 + 10% (1 - 20%)) = 10 mil * 50% * 1.08 = 5,400,000 (5.4 mil)
• Year 2: Project Gamma
○
5.4 mil * (1 - 40%) * (1 + 10% (1 - 50%)) = 5.4mil * 60% * 1.05 = 3,402,000 (≅3.4 mil)
• Total % reduction in rat population of projects Beta and Gamma combination
○
(1 - 3,402,000/10,000,000) = 1 - 34.02% = 65.98% (≅66%)
Project Epsilon
•
Starting population = 10 million rats, Annual growth rate of population = 10%
•
Year 1: Project Epsilon
○
10 mil * (1 - 40%) * (1 + 10% (1 - 100%)) = 10 mil * 60% * 1 = 6,000,000 (6 mil)
•
Year 2: Project Epsilon
○
6 mil * (1 - 40%) * (1 + 10% (1 - 100%)) = 6 mil * 60% * 1 = 3,600,000 (3.6 mil)
•
Total % reduction in rat population of project Epsilon
○
(1 - 3,600,000/10,000,000) = 1 - 36% = 64%

The Rats Don’t Run This City: Recommendation
Recommendation:
• Candidate could choose either the
combination of Projects Beta and
Gamma, which has a higher %
reduction rate, or choose Project
Epsilon that has lower cost and is
easier to implement.
• A great candidate might question
whether running two projects instead
of one (Beta and Gamma) might
increase operational complexities over
what is stated in the individual data or
have reduced effectiveness due to
possible overlap in solutions

Risks:

Next Steps:

• Assumptions for % of extermination
and sterilization may be optimistic
when implementing on a large scale
• Shifts in political environment could
lead to changes from main
stakeholders
• Projects are highly dependent on
successful execution, so there
remains a high degree of operational
risk

• Launch a pilot in a specific area of
NYC to test that sample are in line
with estimates and assumptions
• Do a PR campaign to ensure public
buy-in for the project. If this goes well
future changes from stakeholders are
unlikely even if the administration
changes.
• Establish implementation plan and
timeline for pilot and eventually
full-scale rollout
• Create monitoring plan to track KPIs

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• A great candidate will be very case specific, recognizing the nuances that distinguish dealing with a governmental entity and a
problem of infestation from dealing with a traditional business problem.
• Be able to come up with all measurable indicators when assessing the viability and feasibility of potential solutions
• For the math portion, able to quickly come up with the equation and apply it for two years. The interviewee needs to stay organized
and have a structured approach.

154

Nook Co.: Profit Calculation
• Calculate Profitability of Nook Co.
• Refer to Exhibit A for competitive landscape.
• Refer to Exhibit B for Revenue and Cost for Nook Co. and close competitor.

Math Solution:

Additional Information:

• Nook Co. Revenue = 28% * 1B = 280M/year
• Annual # of Stays = 280M / ($10,000 * 5 nights) = 5,600 stays/year
• Nook Co. Cost = 196M
•
Variable Costs:
• Labor:
• Service Staffs: 2K/month * 12 month * 1K = 24M/year
• Kitchen Staffs: 3K/month * 12 month * 500= 18M/year
• Food and Supplies: 5K/stay *5,600 stays= 28M/year
• Transport and Activities: 10K/stay * 5,600 stays = 56Myr
•
Fixed Costs
• Maintenance and Utilities: 25M/year
• Insurance: 15M/year
• Marketing and Ads: 30M/year
• Profit = 280M – 196M = 84M/year

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
Apartment Co is a residential real estate company that owns and operates 10 buildings throughout three different boroughs within New York. The buildings were built
between 1975 and 1990 and have been under Apartment Co.’s management. since that time. Apartment Co. prides itself on offering affordable, quality apartments for
everyday New Yorkers. The only permanent staff in Apartment Co.’s buildings are the doormen. The company operates leasing from their central location in Manhattan,
and has contracted with a maintenance service, which will be up for renegotiation soon.
Over the last three years, Apartment Co has decided to invest $5M in its infrastructure with the hope of commanding higher apartment rent prices. The company has
upgraded many of its apartment unit amenities, including kitchen appliances, bathroom fixtures, and flooring. These improvements have yielded high renter demand as well
as increased rent prices. Recently, half of Apartment Co.’s buildings added washers and dryers in the basement; the remaining buildings have no laundry facilities. Even in
light of these changes, however, management has not seen the increase in profitability it was hoping for. Apartment co has asked your team to assess ways to achieve
higher long-term profitability.

▪ Expenditures in the short-term must equate to
long-term profitability increase
NOTE: After profitability framework, candidate should ask for financial
data - provide with Exhibit 1 to 5

164

Apartment Co.: Brainstorm
Question #1:
Transition to Brainstorm once candidate begins questioning utility costs:
Reveal to candidate that beginning in 2017, management decided to pay for utilities as part of the rental lease agreement in order to be competitive
in the marketplace.
QUESTION: What are some ways that Apartment Co. can reduce their utilities expense?

Notes to Interviewer:
• Brainstorm should be simple but bucketed into logical categories. Examples include:
•
Demand vs Supply Side:
■
DS: Encourage turning AC off; Turn lights off
■
SS: Building upgrades, solar paneling, automatic on/off, more efficient lighting
•
Water, Gas and Electricity reduction strategies

Once candidate identifies either efficient lighting and/or solar paneling as potential options, proceed with investment scenarios
for each (Next Slide). If candidate does not suggest either of these options, prompt them until they do.
Great brainstorm goes above and beyond basic solutions. Gives creative solutions to the above (i.e. rewards for people with
least energy consumption)

Apartment Co.: Recommendation
Recommendation:
•

•
•
•
•

There are many possible
recommendations, the candidate should
pick one and support it with data from the
case. Options include:
Install solar panels (greatest savings per
year, more savings overall, tax benefits)
Install light bulbs (quick payback, lower
cost)
Do both (candidate notes strong cash
financial condition allows for both)
Do nothing (candidate shows total savings
are not high enough to justify risk)

Risks:

Next Steps:

•

Volatile energy prices

•

High upfront costs

•

Fickle consumer tastes

•

Opportunity costs: where else can the
building make an investment with this
money?

•

Tenants pilfering bulbs given high cost

•

Research solar panel providers, lightbulb providers

•

Secure subcontractor partners to install
paneling and/or lighting installation

•

Pilot in one building to ensure savings
calculations are as expected

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• A great candidate will be able to focus on the important information given and be able to quickly identify that utilities are main cause for cost reduction
(depreciation is due to recent amenities investment).
• A great candidate will be able to creatively think about the risks and benefits associated with both investments:
○
Solar panels: state/federal subsidies, government regulation
○
Lighting: residents breaking/replacing bulbs

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
Hamilton & Hamilton (H&H), a multinational pharmaceutical company, is considering acquiring Sternofi, a
biotechnology
Sternoficompany with a promising drug candidate in phase 2 clinical trials called Deanraghutumab. Should
H&H go through with this acquisition?

Case Overview:

Overview Information for Interviewer:

Industry: Pharmaceutical

• This case is intended to emulate the quantitative cases in both rounds of LEK
recruiting. It is essentially a math puzzle that, once they find the right place to start,
should unravel fairly seamlessly. The key is for the interviewee to think in a structured
manner by recording data in tabular form, which will make the path towards solving
the question clear.
• The decision to acquire or not acquire is necessarily ambiguous, so the candidate
can choose either option, so long as it is logically supported.

Case Type: M&A
Concepts Tested:
• Algebra
• Market sizing

Sternofi: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:

Interviewer Guide:

• The drug candidate treats pancreatic
cancer.
• Sternofi has several other drugs in its
pipeline, but they are in earlier stages of
development and it is too hard to predict
how successful they will be at this point.
• Clinical trial data suggests
Deanraghutumab may be more efficacious
than the current standard of care, though,
like many cancer drugs, it cannot treat
100% of cases.
• Focus only on the US market.
• H&H has few oncology products and is
looking to expand into that therapeutic
area.

All frameworks should attempt to understand the market size and
composition, if it does not, re-direct the interviewee to focus on this. An
acceptable framework will seek to understand:
• How good the drug is; and
• Sternofi’s potential profits and return on investment.
An ideal framework will consider:
• The target company’s position within the acquirer’s portfolio;
• Consider potential synergies; and
• Highlight key risks.
Necessary information that should be given only when specifically asked
for by interviewee:
> Approximately 65,000 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the US per year
(this information will be given in Question 1).

> The pancreatic cancer market is $1.5B per year in the US (this information will be given
in Question 1).

> Deanraghutumab has 12 more years of patent protection from today (necessary for
Question 3). The financials calculated in Question 1 are based on the period of
exclusivity.

> H&H wants to break-even within 8 years of acquisition.

Sternofi: Question 1
Question 1 (interviewer is to read the whole prompt):
Sternofi has conducted research and developed the following annual projections once Deanraghutumab is approved. It is based on annual revenues
and annual pancreatic cancer diagnoses. Assume that the price charged to each patient diagnosed in a given year is the expected present value of
the course of treatment.
∙
∙
∙
∙
∙

There are four major companies in this space: Sternofi and competitors A, B, and C, and several other smaller companies that capture the
balance of the market.
Competitor A has 50% greater market share by patients than Competitor B. Competitor C has two thirds less market share by patient than
Competitor A. We expect that Sternofi will capture twice Competitor B’s market share by patient. The other companies capture the balance,
which is 15,000 patients per year. Overall, approximately 65,000 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year.
From a revenue perspective, “other” companies capture one fifth of the $1.5B annual market.
Competitor C is priced the same as the average of the “other” contingent. Competitor B charges 25% more than that, and Competitor A
charges $10,000 per treatment less than C.
What are the expected revenues and unit prices for Sternofi?

Notes
Candidates are welcome to ask to repeat any information given –
this is an opportunity to assess their poise in willingness to ask for
help. However, note that all necessary information is provided to the
candidate in the prompt, and no clarification should be necessary.
Focus on annual new revenues (i.e., 65,000 patients is the market
size by patient each year).
The “other” companies should be considered as one entity.
After calculating the required information, an astute candidate will
contextualize the data and may mention some of the following:
Sternofi will reach the largest position in the market by revenue
(approximately half of the market by revenue).
Sternofi will be the market leader by patients (approximately 30% of
patients).
If the candidate asks why Sternofi cannot capture the entire market,
mention that patients respond differently to treatments.

Sternofi: Question 2
Question 2:
• It sounds like Deanraghutumab is going to be a major player in this market. What are some of the risks facing Sternofi if H&H acquires it? If the
candidate does not offer ways to mitigate these risks, ask about how to avoid them.

Notes to Interviewer:
Some example risks (copied from the illustrative framework):
•
Drug approval risk (FDA)
•
Merger approval (Department of Justice)
•
Patents protection period
•
Ability to market overseas
•
Insurance reimbursement
•
Competitor response – development of new drugs

Sternofi: Question 3
Question 3:
It sounds like Deanraghutumab shows a lot of promise, and Sternofi is willing to be acquired for $2.3b in cash. Should H&H purchase it?

Math Solution:

Math Information:

Years 1 to 4 net income = $0 revenue - $50m costs = -$50m
Years 5 to 8 net income = $700m revenue - $20m fixed costs – 20k x $4k variable costs = $600m
net income
Cumulative net income by end of year 8 = 4 x -$50m + 4 x $600m = $2,200m
Given break even target of 8 years, $2,300 price > $2,200 revenue, thus it does not meet the
break-even criterion.

•
•
•
•
•

Alternatively: Break even time = ($2,300m price + [4 x $50m] development costs) / $600m net
income = 4.17 years
Adding in the four years of development (with zero revenues), the figure becomes 8.17 years
Since it is very close to the break even target, go and no-go are both valid responses if adequately
supported.
• Reasons to acquire – (1) the break-even figure is very close; (2) there may be revenue and cost
synergies to make net profit higher; (3) Sternofi can look to commercialize the product abroad;
(4) the other drugs in development might be worth $100m.
• Reasons not to acquire – (1) break-even period is slightly longer than required, (2) risks
outlined in question 2 could prove insurmountable.

values are present values but valid for the
candidate to mention this as a potential reason
for a “do not acquire” recommendation

Cups: Question 2
Question 2: Survey Analysis
Proctor and Gamble conducted a survey sent to all US women aged 18-50 to determine their willingness to
switch from their current menstrual products to a menstrual cup. This exhibit (Exhibit A) shows the answers from
that survey. Based on this information, what adjustments would you make to your market size?

Notes to Interviewer:
Additional information:
• Survey was sent to approximately 64M women
• Total survey respondents: 3.2M
• P&G believes this survey accurately represents the population’s interest in this product
• P&G believes they could switch a quarter of the undecided 40% to use the product
with 10% market capture in Year 1
Possible answers are:
• My market size looks right. I would just double the market size based on the
additional 10% of consumers (¼ of 40%) P&G believes they could achieve.
• I’ll add this willingness to use component to my market size (20% after all
menstruating females) and calculate potential revenue with any sales data available.

Key Insights Interviewer Should Look For:
• 40% of population is unsure about whether they would switch to this product. Marketing will be key to
the product’s success.
• Interviewee should ask if P&G thinks they can break into that subset of the market.
• If the interviewee did not think about customer willingness to use this product in their market size, this will
give them the 10% to adjust.

Cups: Question 3 (1/3)
Question 3: Case Math
Given the information in Exhibit B and Exhibit C, how should P&G price the menstrual cup in order to
offset cannibalization of current menstrual care product sales?

Math Solution:

Math Information:

Annual Sales per Customer = Average Price x Annual Frequency of Purchase =
$90 using Exhibit B [Rounded]
• Tampons = $7 x 10 = $70
• Pads = $7 x 2 = $14
• Liners = $6 x 1 = $6
Affected Annual Sales of Existing Care Products = Addressable Market x Sales per
Customer = $148.5M
• Addressable Market from market size adjusted for Market Capture = 16.5M
customers x 10% market capture in Year 1 = 1.65M customers
• Annual Sales per Customer = $90/year
○
1.65M customers x $90/year = $148.5M
Potential Cannibalized Revenue = Annual Sales x 5-year product lifespan =
$742.5M
[Interviewer to provide when Interviewee discusses discount rate]
Approximate PV @ 10% Discount Rate = $742.5M/(1 + 10%) = $675M

• Use 10% market capture from
‘Clarifying Information’ section to
calculate cannibalized annual sales of
existing care products
• Redirect interviewees to use 16.5M as
addressable market, as needed
• Gross up sales for 5-year cup lifespan
• Provide $675M PV after
Interviewee acknowledges 10%
discount rate
• Assume that the calculation is based
on a woman buying all of the products
listed

=Average Price x Annual Frequency of Purchase = $85 using Exhibit C [Rounded]
• Discs= $15 x 2 = $30
• Wash = $7 x 4 = $28
• Wipes = $6.75 x 4 = $27
Estimated Annual Sales for Complimentary Products = Addressable Market x Sales
per Customer = $140.25M
• Addressable Market from market size adjusted for Market Capture = 16.5M customers
x 10% market capture in Year 1 = 1.65M customers
• Annual Sales per Customer = $85/year
○
1.65M customers x $85/year = $140.25M
Potential Complimentary Revenue = Annual Sales $140.25M x 5-year product lifespan

Math Solution:

Information:

Interviewees should add all respondents in each category from 21+
10% of survey respondents: 1,620*.10 = 162(K)

• All respondents for a certain price
category will purchase at any price
in that category
• Remind Interviewee that at least
10% of customers interested in
menstrual cup are willing to pay the
break-even unit sales price
• Remind Interviewee that P&G
estimates that they can convert
25% or a quarter of respondents in
the “Neither Likely or Unlikely”
category to purchasers of the
menstrual cup

NLU: 260+156+104 = 520*.25 = 130K
L: 40+24+16 = 80
VL: 40+32+16 = 88
NLU+L+VL = 298K
298K > 162K thus they should launch the product.

Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• The interviewee should have a clear
position on whether P&G should
produce and sell this product based
on their calculations and whether it
reaches the threshold for the client.
• An excellent interviewee will include
the market size and what price they
would sell the product at if
producing and why

• Excessive product cannibalization
• Incorrect estimated revenue
and purchasing frequency
• Lower market capture/ customer
adoption
• More profitable products to be made
out of the new material

• Begin production of menstrual cups
• Develop comprehensive marketing
plan and contact current retailers for
promotions and shelf options
• Consider expanding product sales for
additional markets
• 1:1 donations to developing markets

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• This case builds on itself. An excellent interviewer will remember each aspect of the previous section and bring it into the next one.
• There’s a lot of math in this case. An excellent interviewer will have neatly organized math that makes it easy for them to
calculate and keep track of their data.
• An excellent interviewee will have out of the box marketing ideas and note that P&G is focused on sustainability.

Question 1:
Quantify our current profitability loss

Notes to Interviewer:
Candidate’s framework should ask about components of profitability and
ultimately
touch upon operations.
Review and utilize interviewer copies of Exhibit A to present information to
candidate. [Interviewer Copy A] outlines the general process of the facility.
Interviewer may provide candidate with Exhibit A or simply read out the information
and allow interviewee to develop structure (far more difficult).
[Interviewer Copy B] provides a visual guide to the quantitative analysis for
profitability. For ease, ask the candidate to solve in daily or per-batch quantities.
The purpose is to test their understanding of the information. Another key skill is
being able to structure all information in an accessible format. Interviewer
should nudge the candidate in the right direction for minor math errors.

Key Result:
Formula X operations is currently losing
$5000 per batch or $10000 per day.

Question 2:
Brainstorm ways to increase profitability

Notes to Interviewer:
Candidate should go back to their original framework in conjunction with their new operations information/data to come up with
solid
ideas on profitability improvement. Below is an example where costs and revenues are specified as supplier and buyer.

Question 3:
What is the effect of running three batches on operating profit?

Notes to Interviewer:
Question candidate on what assumptions we are making:
Key Result:
Because scrubber still only has to
1. Suppliers have enough ingredients
operate twice, we improve marginal
Demand from buyers can support increase in product
2.
cost.Formula X operations is currently
now breaking even.
Operations can support running 24 hours
3.
Question candidate on how cost and revenue structure would change:
1. Labor cost increase: Labor/Misc. costs increase $20K -> $25K for 3rd batch
2. Important note: scrubber still only needs to operate twice.
a) 600kg/day -> 900kg/day waste, which is still less than 1000kg cleaned
for two cycles of operation
3. Total Cost for 3rd batch is $150K with same $160K in revenue.
If candidate mentioned [2] from Question 2, move to next question. If not, probe
on alternate ways to improve operations further to move into the positive.

Fungicide
Question 4:
What is the effect of recycling the reject pile on long term operating profit?

Notes to Interviewer:
Note that client wants long term operating margin and is currently ignoring the capital costs of installing
equipment necessary for recycle operations. Assume new infrastructure increases capacity just enough
to run the total mass of the reject pile per batch (150kg).
Question on where you could place the re-injection of reject pile. Correct answer is anywhere before the
granulator (best answer is Mixer). Note that Formula X turns from slurry to solid in granulator. Therefore,
re-injecting anywhere from granulator and downstream would keep the reject pellets at the same reject
size. They need to be placed somewhere where the process is still liquid.
Key understanding that injecting at mixer would still result in losing 20% at granulator and screens.
150kg * 80% * 80% = 96kg
96kg * $200 = $19,200 per batch
Question how many batches of reject piles you could do per day.
• Note that each reject pile also results in an additional 36kg of waste to the scrubber.
• The scrubber only has an additional 100kg of capacity at 3 batches/day and 2 cycles
• A third reject pile results in another scrubber cycle and net incremental loss of $800
• Candidate may suggest partial reject pile for 3rd batch. For ease, assume reject pile is all or nothing.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

201

Key Result:
Reject recycle can be operated twice
and must be inserted somewhere before
the granulator.
Formula X operations is currently
now netting $19,200/batch or
$38,400/day.

Fungicide – Exhibit A – INTERVIEWER COPY A

Guide to Formula X Process [Read to candidate]:
Formula X is created by mixing Ingredients A and B and then turning them into pellets and sizing them. Formula X is currently run in
batches, with 2 batches a day (each an 8 hour shift). The site is not suitable for continuous operation and is currently at capacity.
For technical people: mass is conserved throughout this process (all physical reactions). Below information is all per-batch.
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

6.

[Hoppers] are metal bins that hold ingredients A and B. Each batch uses 250kg of A @ $100/kg and 1000kg of B @ $100/kg.
Ingredients A and B enter the hopper as a slurry.
[Mixer] is a large tank that mixes the ingredients together in a liquid slurry.
[Granulator] is a drum which dries the mixture and forms them into pellets. 20% of the mass entering the granulator goes off to
a scrubber as unusable dust and water vapor.
[Screens] allow the correct pellet sizes to collect as final product, which is sold @ $200/kg. 5% of mass entering screens goes
off to scrubber as unusables. 15% are rejected based on size, but are otherwise identical to final product.
[Scrubber] collects and cleans dust and water vapor. It only needs to operate once 500kg has accumulated and costs $20,000
to operate once. However, it must end a 24 hour period, completely clean. (ex. 500kg -> scrubber only needs to run once.
501kg -> needs to run twice)
[MISC] costs include mainly labor and all other operational costs, totaling $20,000 per batch.

Hybrid Work Model
Author: Tom Galante (Stern ‘22) Firm Style & Round: Deloitte Round 1
Interviewee-Led

Quant: 8*
Structure: 8*

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
You’ve been called into the headquarters of Galloway Entertainment, a small television production company in New York. The
company carefully managed employee interactions during the pandemic, and as a result was able to get through without making
significant operational changes. However, the CEO has been reading up on the new ‘hybrid work model’ and is excited by the
opportunity to consolidate her real estate footprint and generate what she expects will be significant near-term operational
efficiencies. Her team has pulled together an initial estimate of what it will take to enable a hybrid workplace, and she has asked
you to evaluate whether she should pull the trigger.

Case Overview:

Overview Information for Interviewer:

Industry: Entertainment

Interviewee should be able to:
• Calculate savings from move
• Identify missing data
• Identify qualitative benefits to moving
• Push back against the CEO’s beliefs of short-term savings

Case Type: Cost Savings / Change
Management
Concepts Tested:
• Chart Clearing
• Investment / Breakeven
• Non-Quantitative Benefits

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

Key case steps:
• Develop understanding of current operational footprint
• Calculate annual savings and investment required to move to remote work
• Brainstorm qualitative benefits to remote work
• Interpret graphs and incorporate qualitative implications for recommendation

*Quant indicates how much math is involved and Structure represents the level
of difficulty around developing frameworks. 1 = Easiest, 10 = Hardest

Hybrid Work Model: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:

Interviewer Guide:

Background
• A hybrid work model describes an environment in which
employees spend some, but not all of their time, in the office

• A Good Framework Will:
o Start by developing an understanding of the current
operational footprint and plan presented to the CEO
o Consider annual savings and operational changes
required to support them, and account for one-time
costs required to implement changes
o Explore market trends in hybrid work models
o Consider qualitative upside and/or downside to
implementing a hybrid work strategy

Business Model
• Galloway Entertainment produces scripted television and is
exploring getting into documentary filmmaking
• Galloway makes money by licensing its content to cable
television companies and online streaming platforms
Geography:
• Galloway films in multiple locations across the US
• Operations are currently in New York City, NY, in an office a
few blocks away from the CEO’s apartment

• Necessary information that should be given only when
specifically asked for by interviewee:
o Lease Breakage Cost: 50% of remaining lease value
o At each stage, the interviewee should drive towards the
case completion, and request subsequent information

Objectives / Decision-Making Timeline:
• The CEO’s primary focus is making decisions that are
cash-neutral or better over a two-year timeframe

• This case is intended to test an interviewee’s willingness
to push back against a CEO’s beliefs, and make a
recommendation after incorporating qualitative benefits.
o There is not necessarily one correct answer – but
interviewee should be able to identify that the CEO’s
cost-savings belief is misguided

Real Estate Timeline:
• The company’s lease is up in three years. If they want to move,
they need to break the lease

207

Hybrid Work Model: Question 1
Question:
• How does shifting to a hybrid work model impact the company’s current operational footprint, and how does space utilization
change? What does this tell you?

Notes to Interviewer:
• Ideally, interviewees should drive to this on their own, as they were told the company has an existing plan. If the interviewee doesn’t
ask for details from the existing plan, provide Exhibit 1.
• There are two things for candidates to calculate with Exhibit 1 – the reduction in space requirement based on current employee
utilization, and the current cost of rent (see calculations below). If the candidate doesn’t identify these calculations, prompt them.
• If the candidate asks if the current space is optimal, the answer is yes.

• Strong candidates will also calculate the square footage needed per employee by space type
• Excellent candidates will note that employee utilization does not impact the size of the server room required. If asked, provide this
guidance.
Once this math is complete, candidates should then consider the alternative, and ask if the company has any new spaces they
are considering.
© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

208

Hybrid Work Model: Question 2
Question:
• The real estate team found a new space and need to move on the opportunity quickly due to multiple competing bids. Under the new
location’s lease, how much can they save on an annual basis?

Notes to Interviewer:
• Provide Exhibit 2 when asked about alternatives / the new location and lease (or prompt the candidate if they don’t raise the topic).
Ideally, candidates should drive to this on their own, as the new location’s lease is referenced in the question.
• Candidates may immediately calculate the cost of the new lease and identify the annual savings.
• Excellent candidates will identify that the square footage per employee has changed, and question if the new space really meets the
company’s needs. The interviewer should not give guidance on this – data will come later.
• Strong interviewees will note that the space does not have a server room. If candidates don’t note this, prompt them by
asking how they know the space meets all requirements.
• Provide the following information only when asked: The company plans to move their server room offsite, and has found a 1,000
sf location in New Jersey that costs $5 per square foot per month.
Once this math is complete, candidate should then consider the costs and benefits of making this change. If they do not start
on their own, the interviewer should prompt them to brainstorm some costs that may be incurred in order to make this move.

Hybrid Work Model: Question 3
Question:
• What costs and benefits do you think there are for Galloway Entertainment to make this move?

Notes to Interviewer:
• Interviewee should provide a structured brainstorm. Possible brainstorms incur direct vs indirect costs, upside / downside,
quantitative / qualitative.
• They should identify that there are one-time change management costs that will be incurred to accomplish this move. Excellent
candidates will identify extra technology costs to support the new working style.
Once they have generated sufficient ideas, provide them with
the following information
• Moving Costs (One Time): $250,000
• Lease breakage costs: $250,000
• New technology enabling remote work: $500,000
implementation cost plus $250,000 annual license
• Once this information is provided to interviewees, they should
calculate the adjusted annual savings and the two-year
cumulative savings, and call out that this does not meet the
CEO’s requirements for a two-year breakeven.
• Calculations can be done on a nominal basis (no PV
calculations required).

Hybrid Work Model: Question 4
Question:
• We found some data on filmmaking hubs and hybrid / remote work trends. What does this tell you?

Notes to Interviewer:
• Provide the candidate with Exhibit 3.
• This is intended to test the candidate’s ability to incorporate data for a qualitative recommendation. Potential takeaways from the
data include opportunity to access new talent for their growing documentary efforts, and competitiveness for hiring by having a more
flexible remote work policy.
Once the candidate has spent sufficient time with the data, ask for the final recommendation
Final recommendations should note the following:
• Total change is slightly cash negative over a two year time frame
• The risk that the new space doesn’t meet the company’s needs (bonus – note that employees may not like the move to a different
part of town)
• The potential benefit of enabling remote work given market trends
Excellent final recommendations will
• Identify that the CEO’s belief about near term cost savings opportunity is mistaken, but that there may be other qualitative benefits
to the move
• Question the CEO’s two-year breakeven as potentially being too short for effectively evaluating a strategic move like this

Toto Foundation: Question 1
Question 1:
Based on your analysis, the client has developed a list of potential projects. Determine which project is the
most attractive for the foundation to pursue. [Provide Exhibit 1]

Notes to Interviewer:
The interviewee should leverage the expertise, need, impact scores, along with upfront costs to narrow down product options.
Elimination Steps:
• Upfront costs for blood & plasma delivery and insulin delivery exceed the grant’s upfront funding and therefore should be eliminated
• Poacher and crop monitoring have low expertise and therefore would likely encounter operational challenges
• The remaining two are dry food delivery and vaccine & general medicinal delivery. The interviewee should recognize that both have
similar expertise scores and upfront deployment costs. General medicinal delivery is the more attractive option because it also has
top need and impact scores
• A good interviewee will identify the best product based on the information given
• A great interviewee will draw additional insights related to product and market fit: vaccines are light and easy to transport via drone,
simple to administer, and fulfills a need in developing countries. The candidate may also disclose risks associate with vaccine
delivery: fragile, temperature-controlled, supply shortages, etc.

Notes to Interviewer (continued):
Country

Explanation

1. Rwanda

Relatively high vaccination rates and road quality paired with lower poverty rates

2. Tanzania

Relatively high vaccination rates and road quality paired with high danger to non-profit workers

3. Senegal

ANSWER: Lower vaccination rates, poverty rates and road quality paired with low
danger to workers

4. Guinea

ANSWER: Lower vaccination rates, poverty rates and road quality paired with low
danger to workers

5. Central African Republic

High levels of need, but significant risks from high danger to non-profits and low ease of doing
business

Interviewer Notes:
• A thorough analysis should connect each country’s need with the ease of meeting that need. Geography, population size, and
density should also be considered as factors contributing to impact maximization.
• An excellent interviewer should also realize the limitations of information provided and seek for country specific cost and rollout data.
• It is OK for the caser to select different markets, but the interviewer should challenge assumptions and lead back to the answers.

Math Question:
Calculate annual costs and impact for both target countries. [Provide Exhibit 3]

Math Solution:
• A good interviewee should see that both countries
have annual costs of $1 million per year
• These costs match the annual grant money
meaning both projects are within the constraints
• A great interviewee will see the lower variable cost
in Senegal allows for easier scalability
• A great interviewee will then calculate impact to
differentiate the locations
• Interviewee should realize that for the same annual
costs, the non-profit can deliver more than double
the medicine per year in Senegal because of the
distance / number of flights

[Interviewer-led]

Quant: 9
Structure: 7

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
Your firm has won an RFP to help a domestic airline carrier examine their in-flight connectivity (IFC) strategy. With 80% of USbased aircraft already outfitted with IFC technology and competitive pressures rising, offering WiFi service is becoming tablestakes. Your client has yet to enter the game, but they know it’s something they need to consider to stay competitive. What are
some of the key things the client should think about when assessing their go-to-market strategy for IFC?

Case Overview:

Overview Information for Interviewer:

Industry: Airline

• Candidates are likely to spend the bulk of their time on break-even analysis
• The difficulty in the case lies in recognizing the implications of different
business models, and thinking creatively about how to triangulate data to
uncover critical information
• Candidates should not get caught up on the specifics of WiFi technology or
how it works, but rather consider high-level implications of investing in nascent
technology

Case Type: Market Entry
Concepts Tested:
• New Product Launch
• Breakeven

*Quant indicates how much math is involved and Structure represents the
level of difficulty around developing frameworks. 1 = Easiest, 10 = Hardest

WiFi in the Sky: Case Guide
Clarifying Info:
• The airline flies primarily domestic
routes within the continental US,
as well as select flights to
Canada, Mexico, and the
Caribbean
• IFC includes only WiFi
connectivity. In-flight
entertainment (IFE) is delivered
via an on-board server through a
separate system, but the two can
be integrated into one user
experience
• The airline’s main objective is
to stay competitive
• RFP = request for proposal
• Airline has 90 planes and services
~30K flights per year

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

Interviewer Guide:
•

A good framework will consider:
o ROI and/or profitability
o Price and pricing model (free, ad-supported, pay per data usage, pay per time, pay by
speed tier, subscription service, etc.)
o Market demand (take rate, market segments)
o Costs (upfront investment, ongoing costs)
o Vendor contract structure (revenue/business model, split of investment costs and OpEx,
branding, contract length, technology)
o Product/user experience (built-in screens v. BYO-screen, white-label v. vendor-branding,
speeds available, interoperability with in-flight entertainment, add-on services like calling or
texting)
o Technology (speed, bandwidth, latency, availability when flying over water)
o GTM (rollout timing, marketing, crew training, ad sales)

•

Necessary Information that should be given only when specifically asked for by
interviewee:
o IFC is typically installed and managed by an outside vendor, either through a branded service
(e.g., GoGoAir) or a wholesale, white label solution (e.g., Row44). Contracts are typically 10+
years long.
o Different vendors use different technologies, which vary in quality
o Total bandwidth is shared across passengers, so the more passengers buy a session, the
slower the service (some carriers intentionally charge high prices to limit usage and ensure
better service)

227

WiFi in the Sky: Question 1
Question #1:
There is a wide range of potential business models and your client wants to better understand them before making a vendor
decision. Your analyst pulled these benchmarks on what two competitors are doing today. What are your thoughts on these two
models? [Give Exhibit 1]

Notes to Interviewer:
•

Candidate should recognize that these are not the only two possible models, and good candidates will consider other possible structures. Further,
candidates should not limit themselves to discussing only the elements listed in the exhibit - strong candidates will consider other critical features of the
model (see examples below)

•

A simple way to assess these models is to discuss the pros and cons of each:
•
Competitor 1’s Model
•
Pros: less operational burden on airline, potential for customer experience continuity (e.g., allow subscriptions across airline
carriers), limited costs
•
Cons: limited control over pricing (high price could drive low take rates and anger customers), brand fit considerations
•
Competitor 2’s Model
•
Pros: control over pricing, control over user experience, potential for better ROI, easier to integrate with airline’s other products
(e.g., in-flight entertainment system)
•
Cons: more operational burden on airline, higher costs
•
Other considerations: who will pay for the initial investment, what is the ongoing cost structure, potential to adopt more than one model
across the fleet, technology limitations (vendors don’t come equal)

WiFi in the Sky: Interviewer Guide to Exhibit 1

Notes to Interviewer:
• Clarifications (if candidate asks):
• Assume 1 session buys a passenger WiFi connectivity for the duration of the flight
•The Exhibit is intentionally missing critical information (e.g., cost structure, technology, product
features, interoperability with in-flight entertainment system). If candidate limits discussion to the
elements in the table, ask the candidate if they think there are any other important
considerations.

229

WiFi in the Sky: Question 2
Question #2 (Math Question):
After some initial analysis, the client has decided to partner with a white-label IFC vendor to outfit all 90 of its planes. The airline and vendor will share the
initial investment, and then the airline will pay the vendor a per-session fee to cover operating expenses. The airline wants you to figure out what
percentage of their passengers need to purchase a session for the airline to break even in 2 years. They have provided you with some useful data. [Give
Exhibit 2]

Math Information:

Math Solution:
• To calculate the initial investment:
• Airline share of investment = $250K x 40% = $100K per plane
• Total investment = $9M (solution below):
• Wide body = 10 planes x $100K/plane = $1M
• Narrow body = 80 planes x $100K/plane = $8M
• Total = $1M + $8M = $9M

Wait for the candidate to ask for these data-points:
• Capex = $250K per plane (airline will cover 40% of
it)
• Margins = $10 per session

• To determine total passengers in 2 years:
• Wide body = 300 seats x 2,500 flights/yr x 2 yrs = 1.5M passengers
• Narrow body = 100 seats x 27,500 flights/yr x 2 yrs = 5.5M passengers
• Total = 1.5M + 5.5M = 7M passengers in 2 yrs
• To determine % take rate needed:
• Set up the following equation and solve for [take rate]:
• 7M passengers x [take rate] x $10/session = $9M
• [Take rate] = 12.9% (A strong candidate will express a reaction to this outcome
and offer implications)

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

230

Assumptions:
• Seat occupancy rate* = 100%
• All aircrafts will be outfitted at the same time*
• Ad revenues already baked in the margin
figures
• 1 WiFi session covers entire flight
*Advanced candidates will bring these up on their
own

WiFi in the Sky: Interviewer Guide to Exhibit 2

Notes to Interviewer:
• Wide body = aircraft large enough to accommodate two passenger aisles
• Narrow body = a single-aisle aircraft

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

231

WiFi in the Sky: Question 3
Question #3:
Market research tells us that take rates are only between 5 and 10% today for paid connectivity, so your client is concerned about
being able to hit the break-even targets. What do you think are the key drivers of IFC take rate?

Notes to Interviewer:
• This is a correlation question, not a causation question. So the case is essentially asking: what variables might be correlated
with higher take rates?
• Sample take rate drivers:
• Flight characteristics: flight length, flight time (red-eye vs daytime), other entertainment systems
• Product characteristics: price, speeds available, quality of service, number of connected devices
• Passenger characteristics: age, gender, income, cabin class, business/leisure
• Push the candidate to brainstorm as many drivers as they can and to hypothesize which way the variable would have to swing
to drive higher take rate

232

WiFi in the Sky: Recommendation
Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

•

The airline should partner with a
wholesale, white-label vendor to retain
control over pricing and the user
experience

•

Due to large upfront investment, contract
is likely to be 10+ years long, so smart
vendor selection is very critical

• Vendor selection and contract
negotiation

•

Roll-out across aircraft should be
gradual, with a potential pilot program to
optimize pricing, user experience, etc.

Difficult to strike balance between
maximizing revenue and maintaining
sufficiently low take rate to ensure higher
speeds

• Aircraft prioritization

•

•

Roll-out should prioritize newer planes
that cover routes with high expected take
rates

•

• Pilot launch

Technology is still nascent, potential for
poor user experience

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
•
Recognize the tradeoffs around vendor selection (e.g., the vendor who agrees to your business model may have inferior WiFi
technology)
•Consider user experience, technological limitations, implications of long contract renewal cycles, and operational complexity of
rolling out IFC
•
Incorporate knowledge of the airline industry such as load factor
•
Complete the break-even exercise quickly enough to get through all 4 case questions

Take Your Pills: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:

Interviewer Guide:

Competitors:
• No direct competitors

• A Good Framework Will:
– Recognize that this is a monopolistic market
– Do a deep dive on revenue and its levers

Market:
• The client is the market

– Be case specific and incorporate concepts like
market penetration and patient adherence

Client’s Product:
• 100% of revenues come from just one drug, Nalparcin, which treats a rare type
of muscular dystrophy (MD)
• Nalparcin was launched in 2017 and is classified as an orphan drug (meaning it
treats a disease that afflict fewer than 200,000 people in the US)
• Nalparcin’s period of exclusivity (the period during which FDA will not approve a
generic version of the same drug) will last through the end of 2024

• Necessary information that should be

given only when specifically asked for
by interviewee:
– Exhibit 1:
> Provide when interviewee asks specifically
for revenue/financial numbers

Additional Information:
• Only 30,000 patients in the US are eligible to receive Nalparcin
• The annual price of Nalparcin treatment is $500,000/patient
• Nalparcin has to be taken daily
• RARELY ASKED: Nalparcin is a small molecule drug
– A drug that can enter cells easily because it has a low molecular weight. Once inside the cells, it
can affect other molecules, such as proteins, and may cause cancer cells to die. This is different
from drugs that have a large molecular weight, which keeps them from getting inside cells easily

– Exhibit 2:
> Provide when interviewee mentions patient
adherence and persistence

• Additional Guidance
– Only give clarifying information when the
interviewee asks for the information.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

237

Take Your Pills: Exhibit 1

Notes to Interviewer:
• Provide exhibit 1 (see back-up slide for clean exhibits) when the interviewee asks to see revenue/financial data
Key observations that the interviewee should pick up on:
• Revenue growth is slowing even though the company is acquiring the same number of new patients every year
• This means revenue per patient is going down
• If interviewee asks, confirm that prices have not changed at all – it’s $500,000 for a full year of treatment

• A good interviewee will incorporate clarifying information – the pills are taken daily. Which means each pill missed results in a revenue loss of >$1,000
• A great interviewee will recognize that patient persistence may be an issue – patients are stopping treatment and thus stop being a “customer”
• A great interviewee will be case specific and hypothesize that this might have something to do with patient adherence – if patient forgets or refuses to
take a pill, then the patient will buy one fewer pill, thus Foci loses that revenue

• If the interviewee doesn’t mention patient adherence or persistence, ask the interviewee how much revenue each daily pill generates.

238

Take Your Pills: Exhibit 2

Notes to Interviewer:
• Provide exhibit 2 (see back-up slide for clean exhibits) when the interviewee mentions patient adherence and persistence (see prior slide for
definitions)
Key observations that the interviewee should pick up on:
• Both adherence and persistence are pretty low. Meaning a significant portion of patients aren’t taking their pills daily, and half of patients drop out
each year
• A good interviewee will note that these low rates means that Foci Pharma must continuously acquire more and more new customers in order to sustain
growth
• A good interviewee will push forward and start to hypothesize why this is the case

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

239

Take Your Pills: Brainstorm
Brainstorm:
• Ask the interviewee what might be causing low patient adherence and low patient persistence
• A good candidate will directly go to this step without being prompted.

Notes to Interviewer:
Objective for the interviewee is to provide a good structure around the brainstorm. An example might be:
Patient related
• Behavioral characteristics
• Demographics
• Social-economic indicators
Condition Related
• Patient condition, strength of disease
• Experience with disease so far
Health-system related
• Insurance coverage
• Provider characteristics
Drug related
• Side effects
• Number of concurrent medications

A great candidate will not only come up with potential causes, but also push forward and start to brainstorm ideas that can improve either adherence
or persistence.

Take Your Pills: Math Question (1/2)
Math Question:
The Chief Patient Officer of Foci Pharma has proposed an informational sales & marketing campaign targeting both patients and
their doctors that seeks to improve patient adherence and persistence and wants you to figure out whether it’s worth implementing.

Math Solution: Tell candidate to calculate projected revenues in 2021:

Math Information:

Without this initiative:
Existing patients by 2021:
• Patient count at Beginning of Year (BoY): 3750 (provided to candidate)
• Patient count at End of Year (EoY): 3750 * 50% persistence = 1875 (due to patients’ lack of
persistence)
• By taking the average, you can arrive at # of patients during the year: (3750+1875)/2 =
2812.5 ~= 2800 (encourage candidate to round down)
• Revenue generated: 2800 * 40% adherence * $500,000/annual treatment cost = $560M

Provide the following immediately:

New patients in 2021:
• Patient count: BoY: 4000 (provided to candidate); EoY: 4000 * 50% persistence = 2000;
AVG: during year: (4000+2000)/2 = 3000
• Revenue generated: 3000 * 60% adherence * $500,000/annual treatment cost = $900M

Provide the following only if asked:

Total revenue in 2021 without initiative: $560M + $900M = $1.46B

their doctors that seeks to improve patient adherence and persistence and wants you to figure out whether it’s worth implementing.

Math Solution: Tell candidate to calculate projected revenues in 2021: …Continuation

Math Information:

With this initiative:
Existing patients by 2021:
• Patient count: BoY: 3750; EoY: 3750 * 60% persistence = 2250; AVG: during year:
(3750+2250)/2 = 3000
• Revenue generated: 3000 * 45% adherence * $500,000/annual treatment cost =
$675M
New patients in 2021:
• Patient count: BoY: 4000; EoY: 4000 * 60% persistence = 2400; AVG: during year:
(4000+2400)/2 = 3.2K
• Revenue generated: 3200 * 65% adherence * $500,000/annual treatment cost =
$1.04B

Provide the following immediately:

Total 2021 revenue with initiative: $675M + $1.04B = $1.715B

for math simplicity, assume all patients are
acquired immediately at the beginning of
2021
• # of existing patients from 2020: 3,750
• Product Margins: 80%

Total Benefit: ($1.715B-$1.46B) * 80% margin = $204M – this will drive up revenue by
nearly 20% ($1.715B-$1.46B = $255M 🡪 $255M/$1.46B = ~20%)
A great candidate will notice that while this doesn’t break even on the cost of the campaign, there may be other benefits

Authors: N/A Firm Round & Case Style: McKinsey Round 2
[Interviewer-led]

Quant: 8
Structure: 9

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
Let’s assume our client is Great Burger (GB) a fast food chain that competes head–to-head with McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King,
KFC, etc. GB is the fourth largest fast food chain worldwide, measured by the number of stores in operation. As most of its competitors
do, GB offers food and “combos” for the three largest meal occasions: breakfast, lunch and dinner. Even though GB owns some of its
stores, it operates under the franchising business model with 85% of its stores owned by franchisees (individuals own & manage stores
and pay a franchise fee to GB, but major business decisions e.g. menu, look of store, are controlled by GB).
As part of its growth strategy GB has analyzed some potential acquisition targets including Heavenly Donuts (HD), a growing doughnut
producer with both a US and international store presence. HD operates under the franchising business model too, though a little bit
differently than GB. While GB franchises restaurants, HD franchises areas or regions in which the franchisee is required to open a
certain number of stores.
GB’s CEO has hired McKinsey to advise him on whether they should acquire HD or not.

Great Burger: Question 1
Question #1:
What areas would you want to explore to determine whether GB should acquire HD?

Notes to Interviewer:
Stand Alone Value of HD
• Growth in market for doughnuts
• HD’s past and projected future sales growth (break down into growth in number of stores, and growth in same store sales)
• Competition – are there any other major national chains that are doing better than HD in terms of growth/profit. What does this imply for
future growth?
• Profitability/profit margin
• Capital required to fund growth (capital investment to open new stores, working capital)
Management Team/Cultural Fit
• Capabilities/skills of top, middle management
• Cultural fit, if very different, what % of key management would likely be able to adjust

247

Great Burger: Question 1
Question #1:
What areas would you want to explore to determine whether GB should acquire HD?

Notes to Interviewer:
Synergies/Strategic Fit
• Brand quality similar? Would they enhance or detract from each other if marketed side by side?
• How much overlap of customer base? (very little overlap might cause concern that brands are not compatible, too much might imply little
room to expand sales by cross-marketing)
• Synergies (Note to interviewer: do not let candidate dive deep on this, as it will be covered later)
• GB experience with mergers in past/experience in integrating companies
• Franchise structure differences. Detail “dive" into franchising structures. Would these different structures affect the deal? Can we
manage two different franchising structures at the same time?

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

248

Great Burger: Question 2
Question #2:
The team started thinking about potential synergies that could be achieved by acquiring HD. Here are some key facts on GB and
HD. (Note to interviewer: show candidate Exhibit #1)
What potential synergies can you think of between GB and HD?

Notes to Interviewer:
Lower Costs
• Biggest opportunity likely in corporate SG&A by integrating corporate management
• May be some opportunity to lower food costs with larger purchasing volume on similar food items (e.g., beverages, deep frying
oil), however overlaps may be low as ingredients are very different
• GB appears to have an advantage in property and equipment costs which might be leverage-able to HD (e.g., superior skills in
lease negotiation)
Increase Revenues
• Sell doughnuts in GB stores, or some selected GB products in HD stores
• GB has much greater international presence thus likely has knowledge/skills to enable HD to expand outside of North America
• GB may have superior skills in identifying attractive locations for stores as its sales/store are higher than industry average, where as
HD’s is lower than industry average – might be able to leverage this when opening new HD stores to increase HD average
sales/store
• Expand HD faster then it could do on own – GB as a larger company with lower debt may have better access to capital

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

249

Great Burger: Question 3
Question #3:
The team thinks that with synergies, it should be possible to double HD’s US market share in the next 5 years, and that GB’s access to capital will allow it to
expand number HD of stores by 2.5 times. What sales/store will HD require in 5 years in order for GB to achieve these goals? You should assume:
• Doughnut consumption/capita in the US is $10/year today, and is projected to grow to $20/year in 5 years
• For ease of calculation, assume US population is 300 M
• Use any data from Exhibit #1 you need

predicted to double

Great Burger: Question 4
Question #4:
One of the synergies that the team thinks might have a big potential is the idea of increasing the businesses’ overall profitability by
selling doughnuts in GB stores. How would you assess the profitability impact of this synergy?

Notes to Interviewer:
Basic Profitability Analysis
• Calculate incremental revenues by selling doughnuts in GB stores (calculate how many doughnuts per store, time s price per
doughnut, times number of GB stores)
• Calculate incremental costs by selling doughnuts in GB stores (costs of production, incremental number of employees, employee
training, software changes, incremental marketing and advertising, incremental cost of distribution if we can not produce doughnuts
in house, etc.)
• Calculate incremental investments. Do we need more space in each store if we think we are going to attract new customers? Do
we need to invest in store layout to have in house doughnut production?
• Other reasonable answers are acceptable

One of the synergies that the team thinks might have a big potential is the idea of increasing the businesses’ overall profitability by
selling doughnuts in GB stores. How would you assess the profitability impact of this synergy?

Notes to Interviewer:
Cannibalization
• If the candidate dives deep in the incremental revenue piece by taking into account cannibalization, what would be the rate of
cannibalization with GB offerings? Doughnut cannibalization will be higher with breakfast products than lunch and dinner products, etc.
• One way to calculate this cannibalization is to look at historic cannibalization rates with new product/offering launchings within GB stores
• Might also cannibalize other HD stores if they are nearby GB stores – could estimate this impact by seeing historical change in
HD’s sales when competitor doughnut store opens near by
• Other reasonable approaches to calculating cannibalization are acceptable

Great Burger: Question 5
Question #5:
What would be the incremental profit per store if we think we are going to sell 50 thousand doughnuts per store at a price of $2 per
doughnut at a 60% margin with a cannibalization rate of 10% of GB’s sales?
Show candidate Exhibit #2. Also, if necessary, explain the “Cannibalization Rate” to the candidate.

Notes to Interviewer:
• Only do this question if you feel you did not get a good read with the first quantitative question, or if you have ample time left for the
case. If you skip this question, tell the candidate the following: The team has calculated that the incremental profit per GB store from
selling HD doughnuts would be $15K.
• Incremental Profit =
= contribution from HD sales less contribution lost due to cannibalized GB sales
= 50K units x $2/unit x 60% margin – 300K units x 10% cannibalization x $3/unit x 50% margin
= $60K – 45K
= 15K incremental profit/store

Great Burger: Question 6
Question #6 (synthesis):
You run into the CEO of GB in the hall. He asks you to summarize McKinsey’s perspective so far on whether GB should acquire
HD. Pretend I am the CEO - What would you say?

Notes to Interviewer:
This is an example response. Good answers may vary, depending on answers candidate gave in questions 1-4, and whether or not they completed all
previous questions.

Early findings lead us to believe acquiring HD would create significant value for GB, and that GB should acquire HD
• We believe it is possible to add $15k in profit/GB store by selling HD in GB stores. This could mean $50 million in incremental profit
for North American stores (where immediate synergies are most likely given HD has little brand presence in rest of world.
• We also believe there are other potential revenue and cost synergies that the team still needs to quantify
Once the team has quantified the incremental revenues, cost savings, and investments, we will make a recommendation on the price
you should be willing to pay
We will also give you recommendations on what it will take to integrate the two companies in order to capture the potential revenue
and cost savings, and also to manage the different franchise structures and potentially different cultures of GB and HD

Uranus Co: Market Sizing
Question:
• What factors would you consider in estimating the market size for this service?
[wait for list of factors]
• Due to the high price of the tickets, we will only be able to sell them to millionaires around the globe. Could you please estimate the
total market size of space travel tickets based on what our market research team has put together? (provide Exhibit 1)

Notes to Interviewer:
Factors:
• Global Population
• % that are wealthy (millionaires)
• Meet health and age requirements for space travel
• How many tickets they would buy each year (family Size if they bring families with them)
• Willing to travel to space
Math:
8 B x 0.1% x 5/8 = 5 M are eligible
5 M x 60% = 3 M would want to
travel 3 M x 2.3 = 6.9 M tickets

[Asthma, age, and live in city are red herrings]
[Yes and Maybe is part of market, guide candidate if they ask about
this]

• Great candidate notes that survey responses could be skewed (only looking at opinions of American millionaires, they could lie
about health)

Uranus Co: Customers and Competitors
Question:
• How much of the market do you think Uranus can capture? (provide Exhibits 2 and 3)

Notes to Interviewer:
Key Insights:
• Market is fragmented outside of the top two players
• Uranus is industry leading in all metrics except for cost
• Cost is not a major factor and should not detract from Uranus' offering
A good candidate should be able to provide a market share estimate with reasonable defense. They should notice that Uranus is in a
strong position to capture share from the fragmented 20%, while also siphoning market share from its top two competitors due to its
superior offering.
A great candidate should note that market share capture will be gradual, and that Uranus will need some time to prove itself as
an established player before capturing share from SpaceX and MoonShine.
Allow interviewer to choose their own market share estimate before informing them that Uranus believes it can capture 20% of the market.

260

Uranus Co: Financials and Breakeven
Question:
Uranus Co. would like to capture at least 20% of the market each year and break even within two years. (provide Exhibits 4 & 5)
• Does Uranus Co. have the operational capacity to meet this 20% target?
• If it runs at capacity, will Uranus Co. be able to break even within two years?

Notes to Interviewer:
Market Penetration:
• # of trips/ship/month (2) x # of months (12) x # of ships (150)
= 3,600 trips/year
• # of tickets/trip (400) x 3,600 trips/year = 1.44M tickets/year
• Candidate should recognize that Uranus Co. will have the
capacity to satisfy over 20% of the market each year
(1.44M
/ 6.9M = 20.87%)
Start-up cost to build each ship:
•$1.5B/ship x 150 ships = $225B (this is an UPFRONT COST)
Annual fixed costs:
• Fuel: gallons/trip (500k) x # of trips/year (3,600) x
price/gallon ($5) = $9B
• Maintenance: cost/trip ($100,000) x # of trips/year (3,600) =
$360M

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

• Launch pads: # of launch pads (10) x annual lease ($10M) =
$100M
• Other fixed costs: insurance ($450M) + payroll ($40M) +
marketing ($50M) = $540M
• Total annual fixed costs: $9B + $360M + $100M + $540M = $10B
Contribution margin:
• Revenue per customer: ticket price ($400k) + other
revenue ($100k) = $500k
• Variable cost per customer: $400k
• Contribution margin: $500k - $400k = $100k
Breakeven calculation
• Start-up cost = [ (contribution margin x tickets/year) - annual
fixed costs ] x number of years
• $225B = [ ($100k x 1.44M) - $10B ] x number of years
• Number of years = 1.68
• Candidate should recognize that Uranus Co. will break even
in less than two years!

Quant: [9]*
Structure: [8]*

Author: Matthew Givner (Stern ‘22) Firm Style & Round: BCG Round 1
[Interviewee-Led]
Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
Your client is Green Dreamz, a vertically-integrated cannabis company based in Colorado, USA. Founded in 2011 as a medical cannabis business, Green Dreamz expanded into
the recreational market following state-wide legalization in 2014. Green Dreamz has since become one of the largest players by store count in Colorado, where it competes with
companies ranging from mom-and-pop shops to multi-state operators. Green Dreamz operates a cultivation facility in Denver and 12 dispensary locations (3 of which serve
medical cannabis only, 4 of which serve recreational cannabis only, and 5 of which serve both). The 12 dispensary locations are spread across the state: 5 in Denver (all of which
serve both medical and recreational cannabis), 3 in Colorado Springs (which only allows medical cannabis), 2 in Fort Collins, 1 in Trinidad, and 1 in Cortez (refer to Exhibit D for
a map). Five of its 12 locations were acquired in 4 separate transactions between 2014 and 2018.
As the cannabis industry has matured the market in Colorado has become saturated, and Green Dreamz’s organic growth has slowed accordingly. Although Green
Dreamz and other companies have invested more in brand-building, consumer preference is still driven primarily by price. Green Dreamz’s CEO has hired your firm to
help them find new opportunities for profitable growth.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

Overview Information for Interviewer:
Candidate should ask clarifying questions to better understand this relatively new industry. The case
includes equal parts calculation and brainstorming. The case begins with profit calculations, but then
shifts to ideas for revenue growth. Quantitative and qualitative structuring will be key to
success.Depending on candidate speed, interviewer may move to the final recommendation at any
point after Question 3.
Key case steps:
• Extrapolate trends from a sales chart
• Calculate revenue and profit
• Devise creative and relevant options for revenue growth
• Evaluate a potential acquisition

Clarifying Information:

Interviewer Guide:

Regulations

A Good Framework Will Include:

• Cannabis companies are heavily regulated, with rules governing everything from zoning
and operating hours to packaging and advertising
• Up to 2 ounces of medical cannabis flower (or its equivalent in infused products) can
be legally sold to registered Colorado patients aged 18+ per day
• Up to 1 ounce of recreational cannabis flower (or its equivalent in infused products)
can be legally sold to adults aged 21+ per day
• Medical infused products can legally have higher potency (100mg+ THC) than
recreational products
• Federal regulations prohibit cannabis companies from using credit cards. Banks and
financial institutions are generally unwilling to provide credit or financing
• Cannabis products cannot be advertised, shipped, or sold across state lines

•

Operations

•

Compliance / legal, SG&A, taxes, etc.

•

General Growth Ideas (nothing too detailed, as this will
be asked later)

• Green Dreamz retails all the cannabis flower it grows in-house, and purchases additional
flower on wholesale markets to meet demand (especially for its recreational
dispensaries)
• Green Dreamz does not produce infused products (products that are infused with
THC oil e.g., edibles, lotions, and vape cartridges), but sells those produced by 3rd
party manufacturers
• Green Dreamz sells “trim” (parts of the cannabis plant that cannot be sold to
consumers as flower) to 3rd party manufacturers who extract THC oil for use in the
production of infused products

Green Dreamz: Exhibit A

Key Insights Interviewer Should Look For:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Fast growth in recreational sales from 2014-2017 following legalization
Growth moderates from 2017-2019
Some seasonality is evident in recreational sales, with annual spikes in July / September
A large spike in growth occurs in 2020 (likely caused by pandemic-induced panic buying, as consumers expected cannabis shops to be
shut down. Interviewer should ask candidate if they believe this to be an aberration or indicative of future growth trends)
Medical sales were flat from 2014-2017, then declined somewhat from 2017-2019, reflecting a ceiling on the potential market and/or
competition from recreational sales. Medical sales increased slightly in mid-2020, also likely pandemic-induced
• Wholesale flower prices saw a sharp decrease from 2017-2020 (coincident with the moderation in recreational sales growth) and have yet
to fully recover
• If the candidate doesn’t offer explanations for the trend(s) they identify, interviewer should ask their opinion
• Potential causes for trends: market saturation 🡺 fewer new customers; decline in cannabis tourism; flower price declines from oversupply;
increasing cost of regulation / compliance; potential resurgence of criminal market
© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

271

Green Dreamz: Question 2
Math Question:
• Calculate the profitability of Green Dreamz – refer to Exhibit B for initial data

Math Solution:
• Candidate should quickly recognize they don’t have enough information. When they ask for price information,

Math Information:

present them with Exhibit C (Please note this is pre-tax pricing)

• Candidate can use these 2 exhibits to calculate avg. medical and recreational spend (recommended), and/or
they may ask for customer visits, in which case provide the visits information on the right

• After calculating revenue, candidate should ask for cost information. Provide the information on the right
(interviewer is encouraged to ask candidate to brainstorm what costs should be considered)

• If candidate asks, inform them when they may round their numbers, as indicated below
Recommended Calculations:
• Avg. Medical Spend = [($120*.5)+($45*.2)+($35*.15)+($40*.1)+($25*.05)] = $79.50 round to $80
• Avg. Recreational Spend = [($75*.6)+($20*.1)+($20*.1)+($30*.15)+($20*.05)] = $54.50 round to $55
• Avg. Monthly Revenue = ($80 * 1,500 visits * 3 Med stores) + ($55 * 9,500 visits * 4 Rec stores) + [(0.9 * 5,000
visits * $55) + (0.1 * 5,000 visits * $80) * 5 Dual stores] = $3,887,500 round to $4 million
• Avg. Annual Revenue = $4,000,000 * 12 = $48,000,000
• Avg. Annual Trim Revenue = $2,000,000 (candidate will likely fail to include this, so ask if there are any other
revenue streams they should consider before moving on to cost calculations)
• Total Revenue = $50,000,000
• Total Costs: $10m + $12m + $1m + $6m + $12m + $1m = $42,000,000
• Pre-Tax Total Profit = $50,000,000 - $42,000,000 = $8,000,000
• A great candidate will calculate a pre-tax profit margin (16%) and opine on whether they think it’s high or low
• (“Pre-tax” is emphasized here because cannabis companies face unusually high federal tax burdens due to
selling a Schedule 1 federally-regulated substance)

Avg. Monthly Visits per Store
• Medical: 1,500
• Recreational: 9,500

Key Insights Interviewer Should Look For:
• Average medical prices are higher than average recreational prices (Interviewer should ask candidate why they think this is.
In general, this is largely due to supply constraints in the medical market. In addition, medical products generally contain
more THC/unit. Candidate can also infer lower demand for medical products as a potential cause based on Exhibit A)
• This information combined with Exhibit B will enable the candidate to calculate the average spend for medical and recreational
consumers
• Interviewer may encourage the candidate to do this calculation first before calculating average monthly revenue

Green Dreamz: Question 3
Question 3:
• What are some ways Green Dreamz can grow its overall revenue?

Notes to Interviewer:
• The purpose of this question is to test the candidate’s creativity and ability to devise different, relevant ways to grow the company
while keeping in mind the unique constraints faced by the cannabis industry
• Cost mitigation should not be a major focus for this question
• A good candidate will construct buckets to organize their brainstorm, e.g., organic vs inorganic, medical vs recreational, volume vs value,
low-risk vs high-risk, near-term vs long term
• A great candidate will construct a 2x2 matrix comparing “existing vs new customers” with “existing vs new products”
Possible answers include:
•
Existing customers & products: loyalty program, new pack sizes for flower, price changes / promotions (e.g., happy hours), bundles, etc.
•
Existing customers & new products: branded merchandise, accessories, new 3rd party products, in-house infused products, new flower
strains, tours of cultivation facility, cannabis cooking classes, etc.
•
New customers & existing products: enhanced marketing (earned / owned / paid media), co-op marketing with 3rd party partners,
celebrity endorsements, product placement opportunities, organic expansion to new geographies, online pre-ordering system,
partner with event/tourism companies, etc.
•
New customers & products: celebrity partnerships, acquisition of infused product companies / dispensaries / cultivation facilities, launch
CBD-only products, acquire packaging / distribution company, brand licensing, franchising, consulting services, etc.

Green Dreamz: Question 4
Question 4:
• Green Dreamz is considering acquiring one of its smaller competitors, Treetops. Treetops operates a cultivation facility in Pueblo that
produces recreational cannabis exclusively for its infused products division (which sells Treetops-brand concentrates and edibles at its
own recreational dispensaries). It buys flower and other infused products from wholesalers to sell at its 4 dispensaries (1 medical-only
in Colorado Springs, 1 recreational-only in Pueblo, and 2 dual med/rec in Denver). How would you evaluate this opportunity?

Notes to Interviewer:
• The purpose of this question is to test the candidate’s knowledge of M&A considerations, including revenue and cost synergies,
strategic goals, financial / operational concerns, potential risks, opportunity costs, and valuation concepts
• A good candidate will mention one or more of the areas above, without going into much detail
• A great candidate will treat this as a mini-framework exercise and construct buckets to organize their thoughts, (e.g., into the categories
listed above) and provide 1-2 examples for each
Possible answers include:
• Revenue synergies: geographic expansion, price power from increased market share, new customer acquisition, cross-sell
opportunities, better product / strain innovation from combined R&D, better customer experiences from best practices adoption,
improved value proposition from wider product assortment, higher margins with in-house infused products, potential B2B sales of inhouse infused products, higher marketing ROI, etc.
• Cost synergies: improved bargaining power with 3rd party suppliers, more efficient distribution, lower cost from best practices adoption,
consolidated back-end IT and administrative resources, shorter distance between Pueblo cultivation center and southern stores, etc.
• Potential risks: regulatory fallout, competitor responses, brand damage, cannibalization in Denver & Colorado Springs, culture clash,
Green Dreamz capabilities (this would be its largest acquisition to date), buying a medical dispensary despite low growth prospects,
need to buy even more wholesale flower to meet demand from new dispensaries, etc.

Green Dreamz: Question 5
Math Question:
• What price should Green Dreamz bid for Treetops?

Math Solution:

Math Information:

• Candidate should ask for financial information from Treetops in order to calculate the company’s
Net Present Value. If so, provide the financial information on the right

Treetops Financials

• An excellent candidate will note Treetops has a higher profit margin than Green Dreamz.
Interviewer may ask their thoughts (e.g., likely driven by the in-house infused products division)

• After calculating the profit, candidate should ask for a discount rate and growth rate. If so, provide
a discount rate of 15% and a growth rate of 6%

• (If the candidate seems curious about these rates, ask for their thoughts. In general, cannabis
companies face a higher cost of capital than other businesses due to the unwillingness of banks
to make loans to the industry and the continued perceived riskiness of such ventures. A 6%
growth rate is low relative to previous growth rates achieved in the years immediately following
legalization, during which growth reached a CAGR of 58% from 2013-2016)
• After calculating the NPV, the candidate should offer a bid price around $30m
Recommended Calculations:
• Total Annual Revenue = $50m * 0.3 = $15m
• Total Annual Profit = $15m * 0.18 = $2.7m
• NPV = $2.7m / (0.15-0.06) = $30m

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

277

• Estimated Total Revenue: 30% of
Green Dreamz
• Estimated Profit Margin: 18%

Green Dreamz: Recommendation
Recommendation:
• Acquire: positive revenue synergy
opportunities, improve performance with
best practices transfer, exposure to new
customers, infused products division
provides new revenue opportunities, etc.
• Don’t Acquire: acquiring additional medical
dispensaries is unhelpful, cannibalization
issues, will need to buy more wholesale
flower to supply new dispensaries, no
experience operating infused products
division, potential integration problems
given size of acquisition, etc.
• If “Don’t Acquire,” candidate should
propose alternative growth ideas from their
previous brainstorm

Risks:

Next Steps:

• Acquire: revenue synergies fail to
materialize, increased costs from
integration and additional
wholesale purchases, problems
integrating the culture and brand,
cannibalization, etc.
• Don’t Acquire: missed opportunity, a
competitor acquires Treetops, further
declines in growth from lack of
expansion, etc.

• Next steps should relate directly to
the risks the candidate identifies,
e.g., if a risk is “problems with
integration” a next step would be to
review past acquisitions for potential
pitfalls and assess likelihood of
those occurring with Treetops
integration

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• There is no correct answer to this case. A great candidate will acknowledge the pros and cons but ultimately come down
strongly either in favor or against, with their answer corresponding to the insights they derived throughout the case (especially
during questions 3 and 4)
• A great candidate will be very case specific, recognizing the nuances that distinguish the cannabis industry from traditional business

Author: Liz Mardeusz and Max Soifer (Stern ’24)
Firm Style & Round: McKinsey - Round 1
[Interviewer-Led]

Quant: [8]*
Structure: [7]*

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
Dr. Stern’s Botanicals is a U.S.-based cosmetic and skincare startup and a Gen-Z favorite for “clean beauty.” Last year, the
company’s sales dropped 8% after customers took to TikTok to complain that they had found mold inside concealers less than six
months old. In the wake of the incident, Dr. Stern issued a press release explaining that the product’s formulation, free from harsh
chemicals and preservatives, is meant to last six months if stored properly. The typical shelf life of a concealer is 12 months.
Dr. Stern is on the hunt for a strategic buyer within two years and needs to improve profitability in order to position itself as an
attractive acquisition target. The company is considering two strategies: upgrading the climate control technology in its
manufacturing facility to ensure ingredient freshness, or investing in a new type of airtight concealer packaging to minimize
spoilage. Which option should it pursue?

Case Overview:
Industry: Consumer Packaged Goods

Overview Information for Interviewer:

Case Type: Comparison (Cost/Benefit)

This case can be given McKinsey-style (interviewer-driven) or in a more candidate-driven
style. Instructions for both methods are included.

Concepts Tested:
• Profitability (Revenue/Cost)
• Investment Decision
• Cosmetics industry knowledge

Key case steps:
• Identify key metrics to assess each strategy
• Calculate value generated [in the form of cost savings]
• Assess cost/benefit of different strategies in the context of client’s specific goals

Dr. Stern’s Botanicals: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:

Interviewer Guide:

• Dr. Stern does not operate its own
brick-and-mortars and has no DTC
e-commerce presence. It generates revenue
by selling its products wholesale to upscale
department stores and retailers like Sephora
and Ulta

• A Good Framework Will Consider:
•

•

• Given past issues with product integrity, the
company is not overly focused on driving
sales to increase profitability
• “Clean beauty” is a largely unregulated
marketing term, used by skincare and
cosmetic brands to refer to: the use of
natural and/or responsibly sourced
ingredients, cruelty-free status (not tested on
animals), sustainable packaging, and/or
being free from ingredients like synthetic
preservatives, which some regard as toxic

Financial implications of each strategy
o
Planned capex
o
Expected value creation:
▪
Cost savings
▪
Ongoing expenses
▪
Forecasted revenue impact
o
Timeline - which option achieves positive financial results sooner?
Strategic considerations of each strategy
o

▪
Updated cooling system flies more under radar from consumer
perspective
o
Spoilage mitigation (determine which option more effectively improves spoilage rate)
o
Supply chain impacts (if new ingredients or formulations are required as a result of
either strategy)
o
Regulatory compliance (is new packaging FDA compliant?)
Alternative strategies
o
Investment in marketing (particularly influencer and TikTok marketing to target
Gen-Z consumer base) to drive sales
o
Introduction of preservatives to reduce spoilage (note implications for company’s
identity as “clean beauty” brand)
o
Introduce DTC option to improve margins and expand available channels, boosting
sales [note that beauty is typically a high-margin industry and retail partners
purchase wholesale for up to 65% discount on MSRP]

284

Dr. Stern’s Botanicals: Question 1 - Brainstorm
Question 1:
Ideally, candidate will ask to see financial data for each strategy. Prior to sharing exhibits, ask candidate: what implications does product
spoilage have for Dr. Stern’s Botanicals?

Notes to Interviewer:
●
●

This is a brainstorming exercise meant to test the caser’s structured thinking ability. A suggested, but by no means exhaustive, brainstorm is shown
below. Candidates should segment their brainstorm into logical categories
Once the caser has thoroughly explored factors and indicated an understanding that spoilage has financial, operational, and reputational effects for
Dr. Stern, present Exhibit 1. Upon viewing the exhibit, the candidate should drive towards finding the cost savings achievable via the climate control
strategy
Internal Implications
●

●

●

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

External Implications

Increased costs (wasted product, labor costs
for quality control and spoiled product
disposal, etc., PR damage control)
Increased operational complexity (necessity of
a product integrity testing step, potential
bottleneck to distribution schedule)
Employee morale

285

●
●
●

●
●

Eroded consumer trust
Dissatisfaction from wholesale buyers
Degradation of industry reputation and
negative implications for “clean beauty”
concept industry-wide
Regulatory compliance challenges
Issues with one product (concealers) could
also impact sales of other items in product line

Dr. Stern’s Botanicals: Question 2 - Math
Math Question:
Does it make economic sense to invest in the new climate control technology? Can you estimate the value that the cooling system can
generate for the company? [For a more interviewee-led style, simply show the candidate the first exhibit and ask them to evaluate the
upgrade. Candidate should drive towards quantifying the strategy’s value-add.]

Please share with the candidate the following
information:

Math Solution:
Annual labor cost savings: 100 FTEs x 2,000 hours/year x $17/hour x 20% = $680K

●
●
●

Exhibit 1
For the sake of this exercise, assume a 0% discount
rate
The climate control technology improves spoilage
rates for all products, not just concealers

Annual waste elimination: $5M in raw materials x 5% in eliminated waste = $250K
Annual fixed cost savings: $1M x 15% = $150K in energy cost savings - $100K in
increased maintenance costs = $50K
Total annual savings: $680K + $250K + $50K = $980K

Please provide this additional information only
upon request:

Over two-year time horizon: $980K x 2 = $1.96M
●

●
●

Initial investment cost for the climate control
technology is $2M
Quality control employees work 2,000 hours per year

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

286

A great interviewee should calculate that the cooling system generates
$1.96M in savings over the next two years, when Dr. Stern intends to find
an acquirer. However, given the up-front cost of $2M, it would take the
company more than two years to recoup its investment. Outstanding
candidates might also mention PR implications of employee layoffs

Dr. Stern’s Botanicals: Question 3 - Math
Math Question:
What value is generated by adopting the new airtight packaging? [For a more interviewee-led style, wait for the candidate to request
financials or information on the alternative strategy in order to conduct a comparison.] After calculating cost savings and evaluating the
strategy, the candidate should offer a path forward (i.e., which option seems best.)

Please share with the candidate the following
information:
●

●
●

Exhibit 2 [Interviewer: if caser does not identify 2023
production volume as 1.2M units or close to it, provide that
figure]
The new packaging will increase total manufacturing cost
per unit by $0.10
Typically, Dr. Stern loses 10% of its concealer stock to
spoilage before it distributes product to retailers. The
airtight packaging will eliminate this issue altogether

Math Solution:
Caser is meant to use Exhibit 2 to find units produced for 2023 for concealer [1.2M]. Data on
other product lines is irrelevant
Before new packaging adoption:
1.2M units sold x $4.00 unit cost = $4.8M annual production cost x 10% waste = $480,000
After new packaging adoption:
1.2M units sold x $4.10 unit cost = $4.92M annual production cost [0% waste]
Total annual savings: $4.8M + $0.48M - $4.92M = $0.36M → $360K annual savings
●

Please provide this additional information only
upon request:
●

Current manufacturing cost per unit is $4.00

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

287

A great interviewee should calculate that switching to the airtight concealer packaging
will generate $720,000 in savings over the next two years. Cost savings from
eliminating the spoilage issue exceeds the incremental cost per unit of upgrading the
packaging. Savings are realized immediately. Candidate might mention that this
solution doesn’t address freshness of other products [although it is unknown if
spoilage is an issue for other products]

Dr. Stern’s Botanicals: Recommendation
Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• Dr. Stern’s Botanicals should adopt the new
airtight packaging for its concealers. The
company will see cost savings of $360K
annually

• There could be costs associated with
discontinuing use of old concealer
packaging (i.e., little to no salvage value)

• Pilot test new packaging with consumers
for ease of use

• New packaging shape could have
implications for storage and shipping,
further driving up costs

• Negotiate with new packaging supplier to
achieve further cost savings (i.e., volume
discounts by purchasing packaging for
multiple years’ worth of production)

• While upgrading its climate control system in
its manufacturing facility can generate
significant savings long-term, this strategy
doesn’t position Dr. Stern well to seek a
strategic buyer in two years, as it will have yet
to recoup its investment
• The packaging switch has PR benefits as it
shows the company is responsive to
consumer feedback

• This solution doesn’t address spoilage risk
for other products and could be seen as a
“quick fix” to address specific gripes about
concealer; climate control strategy offers
comprehensive solution with more
long-term benefit if the company can
postpone an acquisition

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
•
•
•

An excellent recommendation notes that not only does a packaging upgrade generate cost savings for Dr. Stern, those savings are realized immediately because
elimination of spoilage more than covers the increased unit cost of the packaging material
Caser can suggest that Dr. Stern reevaluate its time horizon for seeking a strategic buyer, and instead implement the climate control upgrades, which arguably
position the company better long term, particularly because the company has nearly recouped its investment by the end of year 2 anyways
Excellent casers will incorporate knowledge of the cosmetics space, particularly “clean beauty” and its surge in popularity in recent years. They might draw parallels
to the situation presented here with a PR issue faced in 2023 by cosmetics brand Kosas

Mord Motor Co: Market Sizing
Question #1:
Mord Motors sees a lot of potential in the Electric Vehicle space. The CEO has asked that you calculate the size of the retail EV Market in the
US?

Notes to Interviewer:
Secondary Approach:
• US population
• Lux vs Economy Preference
• # households
• % buy a car this year
• % buy EV

Bottom-Up Approach:
• # of households

• % of households that will buy a new car this year
• % of households who prefer to buy EVs over Internal Combustion Engines
• # of cars x Price per EV
Great Market sizing:

• % of households who prefer luxury vs economic EVs
• Suggestion for price points and break calculation into two parts (eg: $100,000 x % + $40,000 x %)
Example Answer:
100 million households
20% will buy a new car this year (Average replacement of car: 5 Years) 100M / 5 = 20M cars
20M Cars per Year.
20% of households will buy EVs over ICE: 4M EVs
75% prefer economic 25% prefer luxury: 3M * $40K + 1M * $100K = $120B + $100B = $220B
After seeing this large potential market, interviewee should drive the case towards how much Mord Motor
expects to capture of this total market and if they have any EVs in development.

The electric vehicle (EV)
market in the United States
broke records in 2021,
estimated at just under
607,600 light electric vehicle
sales. This was approximately
83 percent more than in
2018—the year which marked
the beginning of a strong
demand for Tesla’s Model 3.

Mord Motor Co: Math Question
Math Question:
• Mord Motor has decided to enter the EV market, but only has the capital to move forward with one of its two existing models. Given the
following exhibits of the two models, Mord Motors would like you to decide which model to move forward with production?

Math Information:

Math Solution:
Interviewee should ask or be able to tell which costs are on a unit basis and which are on a
one-time basis.
Great candidates will immediately think about conducting a breakeven calculation when
provided with an initial cost and yearly profit numbers.
Interviewee should first find the unit profit for each model, and then add fixed costs to find
out yearly profit of each model.
Bonus: Recognize that R&D for the model not chosen will be a sunk cost and should be
included in the breakeven calculation (see notes to interviewer)

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
Your client is Curling & Careers (C&C), the New York City chapter of a national non-profit organization. The non-profit aims to provide
disadvantaged high school age students with leadership training and career development through an increasingly popular sport, curling. Curling
is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice toward a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles. C&C rents out ice
hockey rinks around the city to host weekly curling practices and games. Students are also able to opt-in to leadership skills workshops,
professional development sessions, and one-on-one mentoring. High school students apply to join C&C as an extracurricular after school
program. The program is provided free of charge due to the generous support of large institutional donors. C&C’s main costs include facility
rental, curling equipment, transportation, staff salaries, and administrative overhead.
C&C has been growing quickly since 2021 when students returned to the classroom full-time and are unable to meet demand for all their
programming. How can they increase their impact?

Curling and Careers: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:

Framework Example:

Organization:
• Local chapters operate mostly independently
• National organization provides some funding and
administrative support. Marketing of program results is
done at national level

• Demand Assessment:
o Existing capacity/demand mismatch
o Growth rate over next 5 years
o Beneficiary Feedback on positive/negative aspects of program
o Geographic differences

Program:
• Currently 1,000 students in program. Ages 14 – 18,
coming from all of NYC
• Students can opt-in to any of the offered sessions
• Students are transported from school to the curling
center. The weekly schedule varies, but always
includes both curling and educational events
• To qualify for the program, students’ families must
be under a certain income criteria
• Staff on payroll include: coaches, mentors,
administrative personnel, and program coordinators
Impact:
• The goal is to try to serve more students and meet
demand. No clear target

• Financial Constraints:
o FC cost increases (facility rent, transport vans, labor, SG&A)
o VS cost increased (fuel, curling equipment, water, snacks, app fees)
o Decreases in donation cash flow
• Non-Financial Constraints:
o Number of staff and labor allocation
o Facility or transport capacity limitations
o Program cycle/scheduling
o COVID regulations
o Administrative backlogs (applications, onboarding etc.)
• Interviewer Note: An exceptional interviewee will be specific and maintain non-profit
priorities (youth empowerment) rather than just providing typical cost analysis

302

Curling and Careers: Chart Reading
Question 1:
• Provide Exhibit 1
• C&C has done an analysis of the different aspects of their program. Based on the organization’s findings in Exhibit 1, what are your thoughts on
where C&C can focus their efforts to serve more students?

Notes to Interviewer:
Main Takeaway:
• 1 on 1 mentoring is where C&C has the most unmet demand and is rated the second most impactful programming, thus it represents the
biggest opportunity to increase impact
• Interviewee should push interviewee to identify this before moving on to the next brainstorm question
Other possible points are:
• Unmet demand in games. This can be ignored because the New York area curling facilities have limited arena availability and
therefore C&C cannot increase capacity in that area
• They could reallocate excess team practice and social activity capacity to 1 on 1 mentorship. This is a good point but explain to the interviewee
that the people providing the mentorship are not the same as the individuals leading practice and social activities
Clarifications:
• On the bar chart, the data labels represent the % of the total 1000 students that C&C has the ability to serve (capacity) vs. those demanding
(demand) that particular program offering

Curling and Careers : Brainstorm
Question 2:
• C&C agrees that the mentor programming is not serving enough students based on demand. They would like our help looking into this.
• What are some ideas for how they might go about increasing mentorship capacity?

Notes to Interviewer:
There are many directions candidate could take. The goal of this question is to see how creative and specific they can be while remaining
structured in their thinking. Examples include:
Staffing
• Hire more mentors or bring in volunteers
• Free up more hours for existing mentors
• Offer incentives for increasing efficiency/overtime hours

External Support
• Donor letter campaign to raise funds for more mentorship
• Have more senior students mentor younger students
• Utilize mentors from other chapters to provide Zoom
mentorship
• Partner with nearby universities to provide mentor capacity

Schedule
• Offer mentoring on more days of week
• Replace lower ranked sessions (classrooms or fitness training) w/
mentoring opportunities
• Have 2:1 sessions to improve coverage

*Note: Once interviewee gives brainstorm, interviewer should
prompt them for 1 or 2 additional ideas

305

Curling and Careers: Math Question
Question 3:
• C&C has determined the issue is the amount of time mentors are spending on administrative tasks. They want to find out how many more
students they can serve per week if they remove the weekly report to HQ.
• Provide Exhibit 2

Math Notes:

Math Solution:
Step 1: Calculate # of students per mentor
• Number of students per mentor = 378/14 = 27
Step 2: Calculate hours being used for weekly report
• Total hours in week = 40
• 1:1 mentor time per student = 20*27 = 540 minutes or 9 hours
• Lesson planning = 6*1.25 = 7.5 hours per week
• Classroom instruction = 30 * 27 = 810 minutes or 13.5 hours per week
• Weekly report to HQ = 40 hours – (9+7.5+13.5) = 10 hours per week
Step 3: Calculate additional students served w/o weekly report
• Number of additional 1:1 sessions per 10 hour savings per mentor = 10 hrs *3 students
per hour) = 30 students
• Total new student capacity across all mentors = 30 * 14 = 420

306

• The data presented is on a per mentor
basis aside from “Total students per
week”.
• To solve the classroom instruction the
interviewee should observe the asterisk
specifying a 40-hour work week.
• If the interviewee requests to round any
of the calcs, point out that the numbers
should be easy enough to work with and
they should therefore refrain from
rounding

Curling and Careers: Recommendation
Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• C&C should increase their impact by
improving the capacity of the
mentorship program. This should be
done by eliminating the administrative
burden for mentors

• Reducing administrative burden on
mentors will require adjustments
elsewhere. Could result in cost
increases

• Develop an action plan for
reassigning administrative tasks to
other staff. Decide if new hires need
to be brought on

• The organization may still not be
meeting demand in other
programmatic areas, which could limit
their impact even after the mentorship
issue is resolved

• Touch base with national HQ to try to
streamline requirements

• An additional 420 students can be served
per week with 1:1 mentoring, more than
covering the current unmet demand with
little sacrifice of other org functions

• Examine other potential bottlenecks
and compare against projected
demand going forward

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• A great interviewee will convert minutes into hours as the numbers are easier to work with and will streamline their calculations
• A great interviewee will tie back the 420 increase in 1:1 mentoring to the bar chart on exhibit 1 and note that by adding that many more slots, C&C
will more than cover the 370 student unmet capacity ((75-38)*10)
• They will structure their brainstorm into logical buckets and think outside the box for tailored, non-profit focused solutions
• A great interviewee will also contextualize the mentorship solution within the broader non-profit strategy and recognize that this will only
be a part of the long-term solution

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
You’ve been approached by a producing team who have a hold on a major Broadway theater for 10 weeks next summer. Theater is a
very expensive industry, and they’re trying to determine the best show to run during this window. They’ve narrowed down to three
options: a revival of Beauty and the Beast, the Pulitzer-Prize winning play To Kill a Mockingbird, and a one-man show starring Steve
Martin called “Steve Live.” The team has less than two weeks to make a decision in order to start rehearsals on time. You’ve been hired
to assess which show is the best one for the producing team to mount, and how they should price tickets to maximize profit margins.

Case Overview:

Overview Information for Interviewer:

Center Stage: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:

Interviewer Guide:

Competitors:
• There are 41 active Broadway theaters in NYC. Currently 22 host musicals, 18 host plays, and
1 hosts a one-person show.

This case requires the interviewee to
organize their notes in a way that
allows them to go back and re-use
math to get things done in a quicker
way. It also calls back to exhibit 1.
Allow the interviewee to make those
connections, but if they ask or are
struggling, you can prompt back to
previous exhibits.

Market Growth:
• Because Broadway theaters are limited in the number of seats available, revenue growth is
found primarily in ticket prices.
• Over the past year, tickets have steadily increased in price by 10%
• Typical prices are $150/ticket
Client Characteristics:
• Their goal is to achieve highest profit margin possible
• This producing team is very successful – they have launched all three types of shows before, on and off
Broadway (but have never produced one of these three particular shows before)
Costs/show
• The theater’s maintenance fee is $1000/show
• They will do 8 shows/week
• More details on costs in Exhibit 1
• Ideally shooting for 20%+ profit margins
• The producing company can sell things (i.e. concessions, t-shirts) within the theater
“Steve Live” is a brand-new production

Question 1:
• How should the team determine which show the producing team should mount for the summer season?

Notes to Interviewer:
This is the framework. Buckets can and should include:
Financials
• Cost to mount each show (paying talent, managing unions,
theater maintenance, marketing, staff, ushers, rights to use
the work)
• Projected revenues (how many tickets, how many
performances, % tickets sold, discounts)

Center Stage: Question 3
Math Question:
Using the information in exhibit 1, determine which show has the highest projected profit margin per performance.

Math Solution:

Math Notes:

Profit Margin Equation: (Revenues – Costs) / Revenues

The interviewee may try to calculate
profitability for 8 shows/week for 10 weeks.
Encourage them to only do the math per
performance.

Beauty and the Beast:
60000-45000/60000 = 15000/60000 = ¼ = 25%
To Kill a Mockingbird:
30000-24000/30000 = 6000/30000 = 1/5 = 20%
Steve Live:
35000-30000/35000 = 5000/35000 = 1/7 = 14%
Insight:
On a per-performance basis, Beauty and the Beast has the highest profit margin and would be the
best show to mount.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

313

Center Stage: Question 4
Question # 4:
• The producing team agrees to move ahead with Beauty and the Beast. They’re now focused on figuring out how to price tickets. Your team has
conducted a survey among theater goers and has produced the following chart (Exhibit 2). How much should tickets be priced to maximize the
producing team’s revenues?

Notes to Interviewer:
Refer to Exhibit 2.
Missing Data: All unsold tickets will be sold for $50 at the box office starting 2 hours before the show
If full price ticket is $100:
(500)*(.8) = 400 tickets @ $100 = 40000
(500)*(.2) = 100 tickets @ $50 = 5000
• Total Revenue: $45000

If full price ticket is $150:
(500)*(.6) = 300 tickets @ $150 = 45000
(500)*(.4) = 200 tickets @ $50 = 10000
• Total Revenue: $55000

If full price ticket is $200:
(500)*(.4) = 200 tickets @ $200 = 40000
(500)*(.6) = 300 tickets @ $50 = 15000
• Total Revenue: $55000

Insight: The $150 and $200 options yield the same expected revenue. Therefore, we should consider other ways to differentiate between the
two ticket prices.

314

Center Stage: Question 5
Question # 5

• The producing team wants to increase willingness to pay $200 from 40% to 50%. They have a variety of marketing means available to do just that. If
they want to maintain a profit margin of 25%, and all non-ticket revenues are equal to $5000, what is the maximum amount of money they can
spend on marketing per performance?
(Assume that these marketing activities will effectively increase the WTP $200/ticket to 50%)

Notes to Interviewer:
Refer back to Exhibit 1 to see that projected costs for Beauty and the Beast are currently $45,000 and revenues are $60,000.
To maintain 25% profit margin, the equation is:

Equation:
(New Revenue – Costs)/New Revenue = .25
(67500-X)/67500 = .25
67500 – X = 16875
X = 50625 = New Total Costs/Performance

(revenues-costs)
= profit margin
revenues
New Projected Ticket Revenue @ 50% WTP:
($200) * (.5 x 500) + ($50) * (.5 x 500) = $62500

New Costs – Old Costs = 50625 – 45000 = $5625

New Revenue (including non-ticket revenues)
62500 + 5000 = $67500

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

The maximum the producing team can increase spend on
marketing each performance is $5625.

• Offer limited edition merchandise to
people who purchase select shows
• Raffle for backstage tours among people
who pay for $200 tickets

316

Center Stage: Recommendation
Recommendation:

Risks:

Next Steps:

• The producing team should produce
Beauty and the Beast this summer.
• They should sell tickets for $200.
• Right now, willingness to pay $200 is only
40% of the audience, but we found a way
for the team to spend additional money
on marketing to increase this to 50%.
• There are many ways to spend this
investment, including production
enhancements, media marketing, and
offering perks.

• The numbers we worked with are
projected – the reality of the
costs/revenues won’t be available
until the show is mounted
• Broadway is volatile – there could be
another major musical also brought back
this summer (competition) or another
pandemic
• Increasing marketing might not work,
therefore that investment is a risk

• Cast the show
• Obtain the material (if necessary)
• Begin marketing outreach, especially
considering increased budget now in this
area
• Determine any synergies between
existing shows
• As the show goes on, consider extending
the run longer than 10 weeks.

[Interviewee-Led]

Quant: 7
Structure: 9

Ask a behavioral question

Case Prompt:
Situation: Your client, Hoffmann, is a Swiss pharmaceutical holding company. It produces most of its drugs in-house, but licenses many of its most
profitable drugs from a smaller pharmaceutical company called Technologene. Hoffmann has maintained a 26% ownership stake in Technologene to
ensure it receives exclusive rights to sell Technologene's products.
Complication: In a surprise overnight deal, one of Hoffmann's primary competitors has purchased 20% of Technologene's shares, and Hoffmann is
deeply concerned about losing control of the company.
Task: Hoffmann has determined that sharing minority stakes in Technologene with their competitor is too risky and has hired your firm to determine if they
have the resources available to take control of the company. How do you proceed?

Case Overview:

Overview Information for Interviewer:

Industry: Pharmaceutical

This case tests the candidate's understanding of valuation, basic corporate governance,
and critical thinking skills.

Case Structure: M&A
Concepts Tested:
• Valuation (NPV)
• Corporate Governance
• Critical Thinking
• Brainstorming
© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

The first portion requires the candidate to perform an NPV calculation on the target
company and calculate how much additional capital would need to be invested to
acquire control of the company (51% of shares), while the remainder of the case
requires candidates to evaluate different options to acquire those shares.
This case is inspired by the 2008 acquisition of Genentech, Inc. by Roche AG.

recommendation by 4PM this afternoon.
Goal: Success looks like "taking control" of the
company. When the candidate asks what that means at
any point during the case, push back and ask them what
they think it means. Acceptable answers are acquiring
100% of the company, acquiring 51% of the company, or
buying out their competitor's 20% share entirely. If they
provide any of these answers, explain that any party
owning at least 51% of the company has effectively
"taken control," and furthermore that any group
owning minority stakes can be denied decision
making authority. Hoffmann would see this as
success.
Competitor: Hoffmann's competitor is another
European pharmaceutical holding company and can be
assumed to be like Hoffmann in every respect (size,
markets served, licensing structure, etc.), though they
work with different partner companies.
Budget: Hoffmann estimates that they can comfortably
raise $24B in capital to acquire shares in Technologene.
Regulations: There are no regulatory constraints from
either a pharmaceutical or share purchasing standpoint.
Revenue: Nearly 20% of Hoffmann's revenue comes
from Technologene products.

Interviewer Guide:
Several frameworks are appropriate; possible bucket sets include:
1.
2.
3.

Technologene (revenue, costs, strategy & objectives, stakeholders, etc.)
Hoffmann (revenue with/without Technologene, strategy, etc.)
Synergies (costs that can be shared, removable redundancies, etc.)
OR

1.
2.
3.

Technologene Valuation (revenue, costs, EBITDA, WACC/Growth)
Acquisition Execution Strategies (friendly offer, tender offer, proxy fight)
Contingency Plans if Acquisition Fails (alternate investments, etc.)

A good framework must include to some extent:
1. A financial analysis of Technologene
2. Mention of resources required for an acquisition
A great framework will include:
1. A suggestion to value Technologene
2. Different potential acquisition strategies
Ask the candidate where they would like to begin and guide them towards a
financial analysis of Technologene.
321

Pharmageddon: Question 1
Question 1:
• Based on the following data (Exhibit 1), is it feasible for Hoffmann to take control of Technologene?

Notes to Interviewer:
Correct approach: Candidate should recognize that to answer the question, a valuation for Technologene must be conducted and compared against the $24B in available
capital (do not provide this figure until they ask if they haven’t already in the clarifying questions).
Initial Information: Candidate should calculate that total revenues = $9B and total costs = $4.5B, leading to a gross margin (EBITDA) of $4.5B.
From here, candidate should suggest a valuation and ask for the following numbers:
• WACC: 10%
• Growth rate: 5%
Valuation: Inform the candidate that Hoffmann plans to hold Technologene indefinitely (i.e., a perpetuity calculation is appropriate). From here, the candidate should calculate
the value of the company as follows:
• NPV = EBITDA/(WACC - Growth rate) = $4.5B/(10% - 5%) = $4.5B/(5%) = $90B Valuation
Final Answer: The candidate should ask for the available capital if they have not asked in their clarifying questions, at which point you should inform them of the $24B. If they
indicate that the acquisition is not possible because they do not have $90B, remind them to check the objective (taking control, not acquiring 100% of shares), and ask how
much money they need. The candidate should realize that because the objective is acquiring 51% of the company, and Hoffmann already owns 26%, they only need to
purchase 25% more of the company. This additional 25% would cost them:
• Capital required = NPV * (% of company shares needed) = $90B * 25% = $22.5B Required
Given the $24B available, the correct conclusion is that it is feasible for Hoffmann to take control of Technologene.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

322

Pharmageddon: Question 2
Question 2:
• Hoffmann agrees with your valuation and would like to extend an offer to Technologene to acquire the additional shares needed. How
much should Hoffmann offer per share?

Notes to Interviewer:
Correct approach: Candidate should recognize that the per-share price is simply the overall NPV (Valuation) divided by the number of
shares.
Information: When asked, inform the candidate that there are 1B shares outstanding. Therefore, the per-share offering should be
calculated as:
Per Share offer = NPV/(total # of shares) = $90B/1B = $90/Share
Segue to Next Question: After they calculate this number, inform them that they are correct, and that Hoffmann has taken this offer to
Technologene. Technologene has stated that they are willing to sell for the right price, but reject the offer on the premises that Hoffmann
has undervalued the company, in particular its scientists, engineers, and other skilled human capital.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

323

Pharmageddon: Question 3 (Brainstorm)
Question 3 Brainstorm:
Technologene currently has 3 key groups of shareholders other than Hoffmann.
1.
2.
3.

Technologene Insiders: Current employees and management of Technologene, whose primary interest is being valued/compensated fairly
Passive Investors: Mutual funds and retail investors who have no interest in control and will readily sell at current market prices
Competitor: Hoffmann's competitor, whose primary interest is being able to have some control over Technologene

How would you evaluate which group to buy the remaining 25% of shares from?

Notes to Interviewer:
Answer: there are many possible appropriate answers, but good candidates will:
1.

Clearly structure their approach

2.

Address all 3 groups of shareholders

3.

Provide pros and cons for each group

Once the candidate has provided sufficient content, present them with Exhibit 2 and Question 4.

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

324

Pharmageddon: Question 4
Question 4:
• Based on the information provided in Exhibit 2, how can Hoffmann acquire Technologene?

Notes to Interviewer:
Correct approach: Candidate should realize that they need to calculate the capital required of acquiring 25% of shares through Technologene insiders first. This can be
calculated as:

• Capital required to purchase from insiders = (per share Price) * (total # of shares) * 25% = $110 * 1B* 25% = $27.5B
The candidate should recognize that Hoffmann cannot afford to purchase shares at this price (over $24B budget) and should evaluate another option. If they suggest buying
entirely from passive investors or entirely from the competitor, before they do any math, ask them if they could achieve their objective that way (they can't, as each group
owns under 25% of Technologene shares). When the candidate recognizes this, inform them that they can purchase from multiple groups at the prices given. From here, the
candidate can take one of two approaches:
1. Buy majority from passive investors. This is the safe, logical option, as passive investors will sell without issue. We expect most candidates will choose this option.
• 24% from Passive Investors + 1% from Insiders = ($95/share * 1B shares * 24%) + ($110/share * 1B shares * 1%) = $23.9B (In Budget) 🡨 tell the candidate that
including our fees, this will take up the entirety of the $24B budget
2. Buy majority from the competitor. If the candidate suggests doing this ask them if they think the competitor will sell their stake, and unless they reach the following
conclusion, send them back to approach one and continue to Q5. While intuition might suggest the competitor should not sell, in reality it is in the competitor’s best
interest to sell because if Hoffmann purchases 51% of the shares, the competitor is denied any influence in the company, and because Hoffmann can reach 51% with or
without the competitor, they should sell rather than be left holding 20% of a company they cannot influence.
• 20% from Competitor + 5% from Passive Investors = ($90/share * 1B shares * 20%) + ($95/share * 1B shares * 5%) = $22.75B (In Budget)
We expect very few candidates to reach this conclusion but give them kudos after the case if they do and explain it to them if they don’t!

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

325

Pharmageddon: Question 5 (Brainstorm)
Question 5:
Ask the candidate to quickly decide whether they’d like to try and find additional money to buy from the Insiders, or if they want to stay at/under
budget and buy from a mix of investors (make it clear you’re not asking for a rec yet). Depending on the candidate’s answer, ask them:
1. If they suggest buying the shares over budget from Technologene insiders: "How would you raise the additional required capital?"
2. If they suggest buying at or under budget from a mix of investors: "How would you mitigate the risk of losing key talent at Technologene?"

Notes to Interviewer:

Risks:

Next Steps:

Candidate should pick one purchase
option:

• If acquisition through Insiders at
$110/share price, then additional
financial stress on Hoffmann

• If bought through Insiders: Develop
capital fundraising plan for
acquisition

Justification

”Hoffmann has undervalued
our human capital, and many
$110/Share will consider leaving unless the
entire deal is completed at
$110 per share."
"Share prices are inflated at
$95, boosted by the news of
$95/Share
the competitor's overnight
acquisition."
"In the overnight acquisition,
$90/Share
we paid $90 per share."

Case Prompt:
The last few years have been rough for Mouse Entertainment. Their movies have failed to generate returns at the box office, their
streaming service is struggling, and the company is dealing with an activist investor. Mouse’s legendary CEO - Bob Tiger - has come out
of retirement to steer the company again and his plan is to make a splash in sports streaming. Today, different networks have exclusive
rights to air different sports games and they operate their own streaming platforms or cable channels. Consumers often have to subscribe
to multiple platforms to watch all games in a sport. Some customers use cable, which is expensive but shows all sports programming in
one place.
The CEO envisions a joint venture with other networks that will combine their sports properties and be a super streaming app for majority
of games and sports. Mouse entertainment needs your help in evaluating whether this Joint venture is a good idea or not.

Case Overview:
Industry: Streaming
Case Structure: M&A
Concepts Tested:
• Brainstorming
• Investment / Valuation
• Pricing

• Develop a framework to evaluate the project
• Navigate ambiguities in terms of pricing and choosing Joint venture partners
• Calculate the NPV
Key case steps:
• Create framework to evaluate the JV
• Qualitative analysis to determine JV partners
• Pricing of the new streaming service
• Quantitative analysis to determine the attractiveness of JV

Game On: Case Guide
Clarifying Information:
How does sports streaming work?
Sports leagues sell exclusive airing rights of their
games to different sports networks. For example, a
network may have rights to show the monday games
and another network may have rights to show the
sunday games.
Who are the Competitors?
• Many networks / fragmented industry
How does Mouse’s streaming service make
money?
• Revenue through advertising and subscriptions
Mouse’s existing streaming business:
• Has experience with streaming and owns 50% of
NBA rights and 30% of NFL rights
Geography: US
Why is Mouse Entertainment considering this
move?
• To fend off threat from new entrants in streaming
and increase profits from sports streaming

© 2024 NYU Stern MCA

Interviewer Guide:
• A Good Framework:
o Sports streaming market
o
Customers - customer segments (by age, gender, sports watched,
etc.), size of each segment, growth rate of segments, price sensitivity,
preferred way of consuming sports, pain points
o
Competitors - what games do they have rights to, which customer
segment(s) do they serve, pricing strategy, USP
o Deal financials
o
Revenue : Incremental subscribers, pricing, cannibalized revenue, ad
revenue
o
Costs : One-time Investment (website/app), Annual FC (Sports rights,
Distribution costs: Servers, maintenance, Marketing), SG&A
o Risks
o
Cannibalization of existing revenue
o
Collaboration between these organizations
o
Market reaction (especially Sports leagues)
• Necessary Information that should be given only when specifically asked for by
interviewee:
o No Specific financial goal
o Client is thinking of a 3 company joint venture because no two companies
have enough sports rights to make a join streaming service

331

Game On: Question 1
Question 1:
Mouse’s internal strategy team has collected information on the sports streaming market in the US. They need your help in determining
who to partner with for the Joint Venture. (Show Exhibit 1)

Notes to Interviewer:
How to guide the interviewee
If the candidate asks how many companies should be part of JV, you can mention that it will be among 3 players. If the
candidate doesn’t explicitly ask, then steer them to choose 3.
Insights
The sports viewing market is fragmented
Selection of 2 networks for the JV
Fox is a must since it has 60% of NFL rights and NFL is the biggest & fastest growing league in terms of viewership
Duck should NOT be selected because it has only one sports to offer and MLB is declining in viewership
Between Whale and Bear, Whale is a better option since it offers “other” sports (which are played internationally), as
well as 10% NFL rights, making overall NFL rights up to 100%
Other arguments work as well
Next Steps
Understand financials to see how lucrative the JV would be

Game On: Question 2
Question 2:
Mouse’s team wants to understand how this sports streaming service should be priced.
•
Brainstorm ways to price the new service
•
Once the candidate mentions “competitive pricing” as one of the ways to determine pricing, provide them Exhibit 2

Notes to Interviewer:
This is a brainstorming plus math question.
First, the interviewee should brainstorm ways to price the new service, and provide at least three ways. Guide them to make it a
quick brainstorm. Following are some ways that the interviewee may mention:
Competitive pricing (peer comparison)
Cost-plus pricing (cost + margin)
Tiered pricing (ad-supported vs. ad-free)
In the brainstorming, once the candidate mentions competitive pricing, provide them Exhibit 2.
Candidate should calculate the total price paid by each type of customer to determine a reasonable pricing strategy.
There is no one right answer as long as the candidate provides reasonable rationale to justify the pricing.

Game On: Question 3
Question 3:
Based on your analysis, Mouse’s team believes $50 would be an appropriate price-point, and wants your help in determining financial
attractiveness of this endeavour. They believe that they will be able to enter a one-third profit sharing agreement with JV partners, and
want to base the financial attractiveness on the NPV approach.

Math Solution:

Math Information:

Assume: 15% conversion of streaming customers & 5% cable customers (from Exhibit 2)

Information to be provided only when

# of subscribers = [15%*(5+10+3+2)] + [5%*20M] = 3M + 1M = 4M

asked:

Subscriber Revenue = 4M * $50 = $200M/month * 12 months = $2,400M/year

○ Streaming customers adoption = 15%

Cannibalized Revenue = $3B= $3,000M; Incremental Ad Revenue = $1.2B = $1,200M

○ Cable customers adoption rate = 5%
○ Cannibalization on Revenue = $3B/ year

Total Incremental Revenue = $2,400M - $3,000M + $1,200M = $600M

○ Incremental Ad Revenue = $1.2B/ year

Profit = 15%*$600M/year = $90M/year

○ Profit Margin = 15%

PV of Profit (for perpetuity) = ($90M)/(15%-5%) = $900M

○ Discount rate = 15%

Mouse’s share = $900M/3 = $300M

○ Growth rate = 5%
○ Initial Investment for Mouse = $150M

NPV for Mouse Only= $300M - $150M = $150M

Game On: Question 4
Question 4:
Mouse’s executive team has spoken to Fox and Whale and both the networks are excited about this opportunity. However, news about the
joint venture has leaked and investors are not happy. Mouse’s share prices are down 5% after the news came out; Mouse’s CEO is
concerned and asks for your help in dealing with the situation. What will you advice?

Notes to Interviewer:
Good candidate should ask why investors are unhappy. You may tell that investors are having doubts about the potential of the JV to succeed
Potential answerDouble down with the JV
Speak with Fox and Whale, and publicly explain and support the idea of a JV
Explain that streaming is the future as cable TV subscriptions are declining at a faster-than-anticipated pace
No response
Ignore the media
Stock price will eventually pick up as stockholders learn more about the JV
Explore other options
Abandon the JV idea
Renegotiate sports rights with leagues
Think of an acquisition (actually a bad idea at this time but can list idea)
Divest the streaming business (since Mouse Entertainment’s streaming business is already in trouble)
After the brainstorm, an excellent candidate will provide their opinion on the best course of action. If a candidate doesn’t, then push them to do
so

Game On: Recommendation
Next Steps:

Recommendation:

Risks:

•Go/ No-go - either recommendation is ok
•Potential reasons to proceed with JV:
○ 100% rights to NFL, 80% rights to NBA,
and 50% of other sports
○ Increased bargaining power over
customers, and competitive advantage
○ Positive NPV
•Potential reasons to NOT proceed with JV:
○ Cannibalized revenue is higher than
projected subscriber revenue
○ Given that shareholders are unhappy with
the move, raising fresh capital for the
project can be a concern
○ Regulatory concerns

Risks of proceeding with JV:
•High cannibalization (more than subscriber
revenue); NPV can turn negative
•Assumed growth rate of 5% in perpetuity is
high (~2x of average US GDP growth rate)
•Given that shareholders are unhappy with
the move, raising fresh capital for the project
can be a concern
•Regulators might block the JV for
anti-competitive concerns
Risks of NOT proceeding with JV:
•Missed opportunity to create competitive
advantage
•Leaving money on the table (positive NPV
project)

Next steps, if proceeding with JV:
• Draft proposals to initiate JV talks with
Fox and Whale
Next steps, if NOT proceeding with JV:
• Strategize ways of reducing
cannibalization and/ or increasing
subscription revenue

Bonus: Guide to an excellent case
• An excellent candidate will note that the cannibalized revenue is high and if estimates are off, this deal will have a negative NPV. Excellent candidate
will mention this either as a key risk of proceeding with JV or as a key reason to not proceed with JV.
• An excellent candidate will also take a clear stand at points of ambiguity in the case - which firm(s) to choose for JV, what the pricing should be,
what the CEO’s next steps should be
